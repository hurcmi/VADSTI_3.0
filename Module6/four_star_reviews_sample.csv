Really like that sandwiches come w salad, esp after eating too many curds! Had the onion, gruyere, tomato sandwich. Wasn't too much cheese which I liked. Needed something else...pepper jelly maybe. Would like to see more menu options added such as salads w fun cheeses. Lots of beer and wine as well as limited cocktails. Next time I will try one of the draft wines."
1,"Locals recommended Milktooth, and it's an amazing jewel of Indianapolis. I'm glade I had the chance to experience this."
2,"The bun makes the Sonoran Dog. It's like a snuggie for the pup. A first, it seems ridiculous and almost like it's going to be too much, exactly like everyone's favorite blanket with sleeves. Too much softness, too much smush, too indulgent.  Wrong. It's warm, soft, chewy, fragrant, and it succeeds where other famed Sonoran Dogs fail. 

The hot dog itself is flavorful, but I would prefer that it or the bacon have a little more bite or snap to better hold their own against the dominant mustard and onions. 

I'm with the masses on the carne asada caramelo. Excellent tortilla, salty, melty cheese, and great carne. 

Super cheap and you can drive through."
3,"The hubby and I have been here on multiple occasions and we have loved every part of the meal, every single time. Everyone from the servers to the bartender is very knowledgable about the menu and was able to immediately recommend items I could eat as-is, substitute or delete to make something safe for this Celiac girl to eat. The wine and cocktail menus are spot on. The food divine.  My only wish is that they would have a gluten-free dessert, we've always had to go elsewhere for something sweet. But that is not a big deal and I still want to go here time and time again."
4,Went for lunch. Beef brisket sandwich was awesome.   So juicy and tender.    Pulled pork was was just as good!
5,Excellent service! Great diner food and breakfast is served all day. Came here for lunch- they were busy but very friendly and hospitable. Easy to get to off the 295.
6,Enjoyed my fish out at a sidewalk table.  A bit pricey but food was good.  Go to Side street in French quarter if u want quieter dining outside.
7,"We have been here twice for brunch and have enjoyed it immensely. Everything we have tried has been delicious, particularly the grits with scallions and sour cream. But the room is always freezing so be sure to bring a sweater!"
8,"Good food, reasonably priced, and nice staff. Not ideal for eating in, but since they are going for a fast food approach to vegan food, that makes a lot of sense. I know the buffalo bella is the dish that they push the hardest, but for my money the Cheesesteak is the way to go. And pro-tip: Get the sweet potato fries."
9,The food and service was amazing! I only wish they had any vegetarian/vegan options. Can't wait to come back!
10,"Cinco de mayo means margaritas and sangria and all things fried... this great place does a nice job with combining flavors of several different ethnicities and backgrounds and develops recipes that are unique.  Although not touted as a ""Mexican"" destination they know how to rock the rock salt and pour that tequila.  They also just opened a wine bar a couple doors down for overflow and specialty bottles.  A high five for the on the rocks margaritas and house made white or red sangria - definitely worth the trip!"
11,"I can only comment on the vermicelli bowls because I have never had the Pho. 

The vermicelli are a decent size and a fair price. Conveniently located if you live in the Alberta Ave neighbourhood, my orders have always been ready in 15 minutes - even on a Friday night."
12,Took a while to get actual service but once we did I was happy. The gumbo was awesome and loved the chicken & waffles. Friendly staff and right on Bourbon St for good people watching!
13,"Excellent.  Went there for lunch (the budget option).  Prix fixe menu was tempting.  Wife had the prime rib po'boy with the soup of the day (tomato fennel).  Both were excellent (the po'boy being an upscale interpretation, with gruyere and a really good horseradish sauce).  I had the seafood jamabalaya and seafood gumbo, also excellent (probably the best I've had)."
14,"A wee bit pricey for the portions they serve. I come to Beck's for their gator gumbo over jambalaya. The whole thing is just so savory and the spices are just right. It's not overly spicy and not too salty as well. It's a great meal. The gator is in a sausage form. All chopped up into the gumbo. During this visit, I had to order their pasta. Chicken alfredo, for my 2 year old son. It was alright. The whole pasta tasted a bit dry. It's something I wouldn't get twice.

Verdict - Gator gumbo, end of story."
15,The chicken sandwich was phenomenal. Great food for a very industrial area.
16,"The line was out the door, but I had a sandwich in my hands 7 minutes later, and I'm guessing it took longer because I didn't know what I wanted right away.  In fact, I felt a little rushed.  All the locals were running in, saying hi to the owner and ordering up their usual's.  No place for a rookie, but they were extremely patient with us and a few others that wandered in not knowing what they were doing either.

As soon as you cross the threshold, you know you have made a good choice, the smell makes your mouth water.  The Punk agreed so we decided to sit inside (everyone else was outside).

Typically, I would never ever order pastrami, but the menu said it was lean, so I tried something different for me.  Lean indeed.  Best pastrami I have had in a very long time.  In fact, maybe ever.  

The punk was amazed at all the bottle caps glued to every surface in the place.  It is a visual feast to keep you busy and entertained while you eat, if you choose to eat inside.  You cannot see the walls for all the nostalgic fodder.

She was especially thrilled when they brought out her sandwich. When he set it down she exclaimed with delight, ""He knew exactly what I wanted!"""
17,"First meal in New Orleans. I had the $15 lunch special, a seafood stew (with oyster meat, crab claws, shrimp, and redfish) that came with a surprisingly thoughtful salad. Yeah, it's weird: I'm not even a fan of seafood and, to be honest, I wasn't even really that hungry. Still, before I knew what I was doing I had wolfed down the entire thing. The spice, consistency, tenderness of the meat -- all was precisely just right. Well worth your while."
18,"There is a great selection of whiskey/bourbon to suit anyone's taste. We had burgers with the fried egg on it and it was soo good and probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. The duck fries are a MUST if you come here. It is a cute atmosphere although we went with a party of 4 and it was a tad awkward the way our seating was and made it difficult to have conversation with everyone at our table. Overall, a nice place to go. We will be going back."

20,I went there for drinks and found the environment really nice with the brewery right there. The beer was good and the waiter was very knowledgable and kind
21,"Thank you for a lovely morning!  I was in NJ early and decided to stop in for a delicious diner breakfast.  I got a taylor ham, egg, and cheese and a short stack of blueberry pancakes (I simply couldn't decide between sweet or savory, plus leftovers are never a bad thing).  

The egg sandwich was fantastic.  I was nervous when they said they didn't have kaiser rolls so I went with a hamburger roll.  It was an excellent decision.  The roll was excellent - not just an average cheap hamburger roll.  They layered the cheese on the sandwich, which to me is a must for a true egg sandwich.  It was served with home fries, which were sauteed with large slices of peppers and onions.  I'm not the biggest breakfast potatoes fan, but these were great and I appreciated that they didn't clearly just scoop some food from a huge pile of pre-cooked home fries.

The pancakes were great and fluffy.  My one gripe was their use of smuckers pre-packaged syrup.  I realize that if they put syrup in a container, it probably wouldn't be real maple syrup, but I sort of wish I didn't know that they were giving me sub-par syrup.

The server was friendly and very attentive.  The coffee refills were constant, and the coffee was actually good (so many diners fail at coffee).  Bonus points for the server agreeing not to judge my decision to get two breakfasts.

All around, I loved this place and hope to go back soon.  Long live the Jersey diners!"
22,"The new Han Dynasty took over the spot where the old Mid-Atlantic restaurant (with the unchanging menu) was. I like the Han Dynasty here a lot more than the one in Olde City even if I give both 4*. Maybe I'm biased, because I love the service here. They've always been very nice, and came over to check in with me and just make some small conversation when they heard I had a peanut allergy (even though they had no peanuts in any of the dishes I ordered; I think it was Han's sister?). I've been to this Han Dynasty more times in a month than the number of times I've been to the other.

Note though, that the different branches have different specialties. I heard the dan dan mian in Olde City is the best, but the one in UC isn't so good (I wouldn't know since it has peanuts). Overall, I think it;s okay food wise, still not spicy enough as with the other branch. But I like the layout and atmosphere a lot more.

Next, if you go during lunch, you can ask for lunch portions, that are smaller than the dinner portions, and half the menu price! So it's a great lunch place too, alone, or in a group of 2 or 3."
23,"This is a small hole in the wall in the African section of Woodland Avenue.  Though it might not look like much, there is some good food coming out of its kitchen representing Senegal and West Africa.  I enjoyed the national dish of Senegal - Thiboudienne - although note that here they do a version without the usual tomato sauce.  I also took home a Jollof Rice which is often called the mother dish of Jambalaya.  There are a few hightop tables inside for dining or you can order the food to-go.  Either way, service is friendly."
24,"Had dinner Saturday night for the first time at rusty pelican. Called ahead and made a reservation and requested a table next to the window overlooking the water. Hostess went to seat us away from the window, when we questioned her she huffed off and left us staying in the middle of the dining room!! She did return and sat us by the window. The rest of the evening was great, drinks, food and wait staff was excellent. Liz was our server and went above and beyond. Still have to say the hostess was very disappointing!"
25,"This place is amazing! The pizza cookies are a must. It came hot, soft, and crazy delicious. 

We tried the Peanut butter pizza cookie and the Oreo cookies, and both were perfection. I'm very eager to try other flavors. Also, being open until 3am is the smartest decision of any bakery in America. 

The only reason I'm not giving a 5 is because of the prices. But, to be honest, those late nights when all I want is a fresh baked cookie pizza, I'd be willing to pay $50."
26,"I was told this place is a must for a Sonoran hot dog. I was visiting from out of town and had never had one. It was good, but the whole Sonoran hot dog isn't really my thing (too many components for me) so I can't say it was great. The guacamole on the other hand, was great! I also had the taco combo - the chicken and carne asada were very good but the cabeza was slimy. BK has a salsa bar that allows you to help yourself to your own toppings and I appreciated that. Service was good, food arrived quickly. It was pretty packed during lunch on a weekday."
27,"Great atmosphere and decor. Super friendly staff seat you right away. I stopped once for lunch and one time for dinner. They have some lunch specials one of which was Pad Thai. I order with chicken as the protein but they have the typical options for this .  The portion was good for lunch and had good flavor.

For dinner I ordered the chicken satay to start and the Panang Curry with chicken for main course. I was very disappointed in the satay being that you only get two small skewers. The flavor and peanut dipping sauce were very good but they give a few more skewers.  The Panang was good and you get a good size portion of rice.

On a side note, I was disappointed they do not have Pad See Ew. Still some other options on the menu I will return to try.

The staff and manager really know customer service.  Look forward to returning soon!"
28,"We randomly decided to look for middle eastern food. Came up with Petra Restaurant near our home. Tried it with my family and liked it quite a bit. Try their Friday and Saturday special rice (it actually test like Indian fried rice) with lamb. Really tasty. Other things are very good too. Don't be discouraged with the location of the place, but food is good and inside of the restaurant is quite nice. Service is good too."
29,New owners turned it into a double threat: Bad food AND bad service. Shame. I loved this place.
30,I attended a meeting for the homebuilders Association of New Orleans here. The food was good and they took good care of the patrons. I had a mimosa which was good. I had a small cup of corn and crab soup which is fantastic but the portion was quite small. I had the grits and grillades and it was fantastic! The portion same grade on this one. The price was around $10. I've included a photo of the menu for your convenience. I didn't get a chance to test the Wi-Fi but I would say given the ambience and the quality of the food it's a repeat
31,"Super lunch option
Watch out for the yoga mats
You won't miss the meat

Lunch has been very strange for me since HipCity opened. Because here's the thing: I am a meat eater. I mean like my last meal on earth would be a burger. Or, just maybe, the fajita wrap. Because it's that good.

Haven't had everything on the menu yet, but everything I have had has been great. The buffalo bella and crispy hipcity ranch are amazing sandwich alternatives, especially paired with the green lemonade. The groothie is also delicious, and can stand on its own to get you through an afternoon if you only want to spend a few bucks.

Okay suffice it to say that the food is great. The staff is also very friendly, and when they get busy someone will come out along the line and take orders so congestion doesn't get too bad at the register itself.

My only issue with HipCity is that it is at times nearly impossible to figure out where to stand when you're waiting to order or waiting for your food. People kind of convene everywhere and it can get awkward when there's a line out the door. In such a small space it's hard to rectify, but if I see a line out the door I tend to walk on by not because it's a long wait (they're really efficient), it's just difficult to navigate the interior."
32,"The restaurant was very nicely decorated , and clean. There were six of us and everyone enjoyed their meals . I had the fried green tomatoes. They were perfectly seasoned and the sauce served with them was delicious. The down side is they arrived after everyone else had their meals . My friends had the chicken salad , the fried bologna sandwich and a cheeseburger. We shared the peach cobbler dessert and were not disappointed, get it with the ice cream !!"
33,"We loved the food, service and decor! The minute we walked in for a late lunch we were greeted with a huge smile and a warm welcome from the manager. Our server, Christina (i think that was her name) was delightful. The beer selection was great. We had the chicken rabe sandwhich and pepperoni pizza. The sandwhich was very good, on tasty foccacia bread. The pizza was superb!  We love the ""well done"" taste. We will definately be back. One problem we may have is our 7 year old is very picky and we didn't see a chidren's menu."
34,"This review is mainly chicken talk as Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken brings to the table. Pollo a la brasa.... Rotisserie chicken.... Whatever you wanna call it.... I call it a technique done here with love and pride. Lets be clear, you will find no comparison coming from your grocer deli section or at the checkout isle.

Why do I think this chicken have some TLC put into it? On biting down of this chicken you can note seasoning flavors down to the bone. This is an inclination that prior to even getting into the rotisserie oven, these birds spend some time in some form of marinating process. Building flavor, the chicken also has a seasoning rub all over the skin.

Lets go to this rotisserie oven. Another unique element is this oven has a charcoal or grill like component. This gives the chicken a smoky element in the flavor build. As these birds turn in this oven, they keep moist from the natural drippings dropping from bird to bird as they rotate through this oven. In turn, this a reason why some people may note some pieces the skin end up dry and crispy and others get moist or soggy skin on their chicken In the end, you end up with this tender, smoky, well seasoned, fall off the bone goodness. Wait.... how can they add more flavor? Cuenelli's serves it with two dipping sauces, a chimichurri  which gives a herbaceous and slightly spicy flavor, and an aioli which has a garlicky - lemony element.

Round out this meal with some solid sides. Must haves for me would be the cilantro rice. Another herbaceous addition that works well with this meal. I got to use the word herbaceous a few times in this review, it has reflects such great imagery for food talk:) Must have beans with rice no? I pick the spicy pinto beans over the black beans at this establishment but lets be clear these beans are pretty spicy. I also love the maduros here. These sweet plantatains are cooked to perfection where the outsides has this caramelization from the natural sugar of the sweet plantain, leaving you with this toffee-like, stick to your tooth exterior and soft and sweet interior. 

Wash all down with Inca cola or a bottle of chicha limena.  Inca cola is almost like a cola champagne or a cream soda type of drink. Chicha Limena I say is Christmas in a bottle. This juice has a floral base blended with cinnamon and cloves.

Though Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken have many other notable Latin dishes, the one thing that comes to mind to me is this chicken made with love. This chicken gives new meaning to all who thought they knew what rotisserie chicken is. I say, go to Cuenelli's and taste again for the very first time."
35,"fuck yes. meat, bourbon libations, and a salad (to round things out aka make myself feel better about ingesting the aforementioned two items.) i took myself on an early birthday date with myself and was not disappointed (neither in the food nor the company). i had a medium rare plain burger to see if it was worth all the fuss...no cheese, bacon, dressing, etc to disguise the quality of the meat. (of course, no bread either since i'm gluten free.) the burger was great - perfectly cooked and seasoned... though, i felt like a bit of a freak sitting at the bar eating my burger with a knife and a fork. i'd like to come back to try a fancypants burger since the extras look pretty tasty.  the salad was so-so; it was no frills with the perfect amount of dressing. the bartender-cum-waiter was super attentive but not cloyingly so. he made delicious sazeracs to accompany my repast."
36,"I deducted one star because the service was not great. Our waiter wasn't friendly at all. The first question was ""soup or salad "". I wanted to order appetizer and lunch special, but he assumed we were having lunch. Seaweed salad was really good. Shiomay was small but good. The sashimi was fresh. Banzai roll was great and unique. Raw salmon and white fish with avocado and fish egg wrapped in cucumber with some sweet sauce. Perfect for those who is looking for no-rice roll. Salad dressing was more like carrot purée."
37,"My boyfriend and I both decided to try Jesse's for the first time after we'd both grown up in the Brandon area and neither of us had ever been, and really hadn't heard much about the restaurant. 

We dined on a Saturday night and even though the parking lot and restaurant was packed, we were sat right away at a 2-top next to a window facing SR-60. 

Our server, Nikki, greeted us in a reasonable amount of time. We ordered our beverages and she brought them shortly after that. Something I did not like was there was not a drink menu on the table, but Nikki was able to tell us what beers were on draft and non-alcoholic drinks. She took our appetizer and entree order all at once. 

We ordered crab stuffed mushrooms and a French onion soup to share. These items came out together. The crab stuffed mushroom was basically a giant thing of crab stuffing on a TINY mushroom, which was almost laughable, but had a good flavor nonetheless. The French onion soup had a great flavor and wasn't scalding hot, which was super nice to eat right away. 

After our appetizer came out and we finished it, our Caesar salads came out as well as a loaf of bread and some butter. This was also really great pacing of our meal! Nikki never let empty plates sit on our table, was very attentive, and always made sure we had drinks in front of us. The Caesar salads were good. I gave the bread two chances... once dipped in the French onion soup and once just with butter on it... the bread could have definitely been better - it just didn't have a good flavor to it. 

I ordered the 6 oz filet and he ordered the 16 oz Delmonico - both cooked medium rare. The steaks are served with sautéed mushrooms, your choice of side, and a salad or soup of the day, which isn't mentioned anywhere on the menu. I got broccoli as my side and my boyfriend got a sweet potato with all the fixings. I saw three tables sat after us receive their entrees before us - I don't know if it was a kitchen issue or something else, but we were sat at least five minutes before each of those tables - I tried to make sense of the delay, but it honestly wasn't a big deal to me. Our steaks came out on hot metal plates that were inserted into a cooler outer shell. My filet was nice and thick and cooked perfectly and the broccoli was steamed very tenderly, but there were not enough sautéed mushrooms on the plate, in my opinion. If I had known it would have been like five mushrooms with the steak, I totally would have gotten them as a side. My boyfriend's steak was cooked perfectly as well, but being on the hot metal dish led the steak to cook more at the table, which he wasn't particularly pleased with. He enjoyed his sweet potato with butter, but it didn't come out with cinnamon on it like he requested. 

Anyway, I am sure we will return! Our server, Nikki, was fabulous. She was extremely attentive, had a great attitude, and was knowledgeable!"
38,"Don't judge a book by it's cover.  Looked like a any similar bar food type chain like Friday's, Bennigan's, or Ruby Tuesdays... JB Dawson's is far better.
Awesome experience from the second we stepped in, hostess greeted us with a smile and time to table waiting expectation.  We were promptly seated, and tended to right away with a smile and good attitude by a server, Nancy, who helped us with a beverage and app order.  

For our app we shared the twisted shrimp as it was Twisted Tuesday.  Nancy told us this dish far surpassed Bone Fish's Bang Bang Shrimp, to our surprise, it clearly did.  Our beverage and app shortly followed. 

Shortly there after another server stopped by, Kyle, who was our designated server.  Boy, smile, great greeting, great attitude, engaging.  We talked a bit, figured our way through the menu and placed our order.

For our dishes, my wife selected the Four Cheese Mac & Cheese side -- Sharp Cheddar, Pepperjack, Mozzarella & Reggiano dusted with bread crumbs with cornbread as she had large lunch.  Very good.  Unexpected, light, not overly creamy, not burnt, just right.  And the corn bread with maple butter..... ahhhhhh that was really nice.

 I ordered the fish tacos-- 3 Flour tortillas, seasoned tilapia, chimichurri sauce, mango cilantro salsa & a lime cream drizzle.  Passed on starch sides and had their asparagus that was cooked to perfection.  To my surprise the they were filling, nice size portion (see photo)  not a two bite app.  Very moist and super fresh fish.

Great first experience all around expect one key aspect.  Their so called craft beer menu was really limited and did not contain a variety of types; focused more on IPAs.  Limited thinking for the bar manager I must say.  Kyle our waiter also bar-tends.  We got to talking and he offered with no questions to swap out my beer for another option --- Stoudts Scarlet, which is a reddish beer.  For my beer palette it was better then the others limited options had a nice taste at the swallow then waned off.   Kyle informed us that they buy for all 4 restaurants and try to find a middling that works across the 4 guest demographics.  Not a great decision honestly.  There are so many great craft brewers in the Bucks County region and even Bristol area that should be showed cased and tested through.  For me a bad or poor beer selection stunts the overall experience.

We'll be back but I may need to sneak in my own beer selections from my craft collection."
39,Pancake Pantry is an institution in Nashville. A place to see country stars and have a great breakfast. Pancakes are good. It's a thing to do in Nashville. Plan to stand in line and enjoy the conversation.
40,"The Tuck Special. So good I would drive all the way back out to Nashville from TX just to have it again. It's a mix of strange ingredients- brisket, egg, pimento cheese but combined they are an amazing flavor combination. My husband didn't care for the BBQ sauce on the table, but meat was pretty good. I can see how this place gets crowded, but if you have patience and look up the menu ahead of time, it should be manageable."
41,"My boyfriend and I decided to stop by for lunch yesterday, and I am so glad we did. I ordered a side of beans, chips and salsa, and guacamole. He ordered two steak tacos and a side of rice. The beans are hands down my favorite I've had from a mexican restaurant.  My only complaint is that, unfortunately you do not get a very big portion. The salsa is so fresh tasting and delicious-very cilantro forward, and the chips were nice, thick and crunchy without being oily at all. Take note though, chips and salsa are not included with your purchase and must be bought separately. Now let me get to the best part-the made to order, chunky guacamole. The hardy chips would definitely withstand this heavy duty guac, but I opted instead for tortillas as my vessel to stuff it with along with my beans and salsa. The hot sauces were anything but, though admittedly my tolerance to spices may be higher than the average persons. While I had a great eating experience, my boyfriend did not. He said the meat was of low quality and quite flavorless. He did say he would give it another shot though!"
42,"I love this place. It's been in La Cumbre Plaza for I don't know how long now. If you are looking for a good sandwich look no further. All of the ingredients taste fresh, and their bread rolls are amazing. They are nice and soft, not with that cut the roof of your mouth crust. Being born and raise in Santa Barbara, actually just down the street, I have been coming here for some years now. I've tried probably over half of their sandwiches and all have been good, so good it's hard to pick a favorite.  In addition, I cannot forget to mention their awesome soda selection, so awesome I cannot hesitate to try something different with every visit. You won't find anything super fancy or exotic, like a roasted duck pastrami sandwich here, but if you're a local or just passing through and feel like having a great sandwich with good fresh ingredients swing by Plaza Deli and grab a bite."
43,"Service is excellent. Atmosphere is great. The raw bar was fantastic. Those were the best Alaskan crab legs I've had. Well worth splurging for them. 

My friends were drawn in by the awesome looking burger they had, and indeed the burgers were all they hoped for. It came with a generous portion of crispy fries. But if you want anything else besides the $17 burgers, expect to spend over $30 for your entree. While the ambience feels and looks casual, it is fine dining.

Unfortunately, the waiter did sell the shrimp and grits with the additional crab as ""heaven in his mouth"", but that it was not. I've had better shrimp and grits in Atlanta, and there is no reasonable way you should be paying $30 for shrimp and GRITS. Without the crab, it was still over $20.

But everything else was great. Drinks were delicious. Everything came out pretty quickly. Oh, when we mentioned we were visiting from out of town, the waiter was nice enough to give us a complimentary appetizer of the cool pizza to start. It was great but the name is hard to say or remember. And the rabbit and chicken liver pate was super worth since it comes in a huge mason jar.

I recommend sticking to the drinks, appetizers, and burgers and you'll be a pretty happy camper."
44,This amazing brick oven pizza joint gets better every time I go. The last I time I went I got a Rotolo and a prosciutto pizza. The Rotolo is dough wrapped around mortadella and ricotta cheese and topped with pistachios and oil. It is so good. I order it every time. It's about the size of a bun and cost $5. The pizza was amazing. The prosciutto was incredibly tasty. The dough is divine. The service is always great and the beer selection is good. Definitely one of the best pizza places in Philly.
45,"I love the concept of this place. One half of it a café that serves different types of coffees and teas, and breakfast type items, and the other world where it serves bar type apps, salads, and sandwiches,  Can't forget that they also serve a wide variety of beers that they serve on tap, bottled, or in can.  

This place is pretty darn casual, and one can hang out here for hours with their friends.  Reminds me of the good ol' college days when no time could pass especially on a chill out Sunday Fun day.

Bring your four legged friend too.  They are totally welcome."
46,"Second visit even better than the first!!  Loved the butternut squash and goat cheese Rangoons, and the delightfully filling mushroom yakisoba. Amazing flavor, and a smoky , meaty feel though it is meatless. Then came the coconut curry ramen. Heaven in a bowl. 
My only complaint is when you have to wait for seating there is no way to hang by the bar without constantly feeling you are in The servers' way as they breeze by with deliciousness in bowls and plates. So worth the wait before heading to the theater. Plus, food comes out very quickly so we made the curtain, just barely, but with really happy tummies."
47,"Excellent food, good service, great location. 

My wife had shrimp and grits, I had the barbecued shrimp -- both were outstanding. The appetizers were good. The bread pudding was a tad dry in the city that is supposed to be the mother lode of bread pudding. 

Mr. B came close to snagging the fifth star but the service could have been more attentive and the place is freezing - - in July in New Orleans. Wear long sleeves or bring a jacket."
48,"Walked by this place and decided to check it out. Great beer and burger place, made even better knowing many things were organic. You can order from the menu, or create your own burger. They also have rotating beers and specials. Nice atmosphere and staff. Burgers don't come with anything, so order from the sides if you want some fries. (There's also sandwiches and salads if you don't want a burger) Vegetarian friendly."
49,Came to see my son's band Last Frontier. The staff and food here is top notch!   Had the porkbelly and fish nachos.  Awesome.  Great selection of whisky. Great sound system for the band.
50,"I'm pretty sure this place has been open since before I was born and it's no surprise as to why. 

The absolute classic of an American diner, polite and attentive waitresses and most of their food made entirely from scratch. I would definitely say their fried chicken is the best I've had before, and fresh! Bottomless coffee too, for $1.75 which I think is quite reasonable. Nice pie, too :)"
51,"I attended the #welldoneTBO tweet-up at Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza last week and had a great time. The folks at Anthony's were amazing with the customer service. We got to try so many menu items, and all were amazing. The Philly Cheesesteak Pizza was my 10 year old's favorite. I loved the Cauliflower pizza...so buttery and garlicky and delicious (vegetarian). We also got to try the carmelized onion-smothered wings which were out of this world. Also tasted: meatballs, ribs, salad...all very good. We ordered off the menu a half and half pizza with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms. So good. If they had liquor on the menu I would have given them five stars (I'm just not a beer or wine person). Thanks for a great evening Anthony's! We'll be back."
52,"A great restaurant to take people visiting from out of town. Very popular for breakfast/brunch on the weekends. Should expect to wait at least an hour any time after 9:30 AM and service takes a little while. But great menu options and delicious food. Also a great bakery, coffee and gelato counter that offers instant service or items to enjoy while waiting to get called."
53,"Excellent tasting Po-Boys but it could have had mire catfish, pretty skimpy.
Service, very good."
54,"On my first day in New Orleans, I walked to Fair Grinds for a caffeine boost. It was a beautiful afternoon, and a handful of people were scattered around the shop and the outdoor seating area, working on laptops and visiting with friends. 

I ordered a small cold brew with vanilla, easy on the ice. I added a hunk of gluten free zucchini bread (the bread butt; the best part!) to my order and paid with a credit card. They have a fancy touchscreen register that lets you add tip to your card purchase. 

I topped off my drink with whole milk -- which in itself was a real treat. It's so rare to see whole milk at the mixing station! 

Before leaving, I asked what else they had in the way of a GF offering, and the young man behind the counter said ""just the zucchini bread."" That's a real bummer; the zucchini bread is great but I'd love to have more than one option. 

My drink was smooth and had a perfect flavor. I was happy with my choices. 

If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd be here all the time. I like the hipstery feeling of this place, and everything I've ordered has been delightful."
55,"I loved this place!  We drove down from Tahoe just to eat here!  The 90 miles round trip was worth it!  The food was that good!  The Chicken Basil was the best!  And they have good Boba Tea!

Don't believe the nay-sayer about this place.  The food was pretty authentic Taiwanese.  Try it and see for yourself!"
56,"Cru is such a cute quaint wine bar! In the front is a wine store and in the back ins the wine bar. The wine bar area is small but had a very modern atmosphere.

I started off with the Vina Vino wine flight and my friends ordered The Bold and the Beautiful. Both came on a cute wood/chalkboard board with the wine written in chalk. All the wines were very tasty but the Vespucci  Primitivo and the Il Fauno di Arcanum were my favorite.

We then ordered the fig jam and prosciutto, bleu cheese, arugula flatbread. A little heavy on the blue cheese for my liking but overall was really good. We also ordered the Farmers Platter. You can choose anything from 1-7 items and build your plate from a variety of cheese and meats. We selected the Brillat-Savarin, Cypress Grove ""Purple Haze"", Blue Brie, Spressata and the Italian Speck. The farmers plate also came with jam, mustard,  caramelized nuts and crostini. The Farmers plate by far was my favorite!

Overall I really liked CRU. Its cute, quaint and cozy. Can't wait to come back!!"
57,"It may be a bit pricey, but it's good food in the cafe and a good selection in the grocery. I love their vegan sandwich and tofu melt and they always have a great selection of vegan sweets."
58,"First impression:

Home Wine Kitchen's ""No Menu Monday"" is a must-try for anyone interested in the St. Louis fine dining scene or good food more generally.  We came prepared with reservations, but the restaurant actually began quieting out while our delicious meal was ramping up; the tables offer more elbow room than the photographs online belie.  As the name of the evening suggests, no menu is in play here; you'll let your friendly server know if you have any food allergies or particular preferences, and before long watch your customized meal unfold.  That's a three-course meal, $30, plus $12 for three half-glass wine pairings.

As starters, we were served lamb meatballs -- likely the favorite of the night -- and goat cheese-stuffed poblano peppers.  The peppers had a good bit of spice offset by the chalkiness of the goat cheese, making an excellent pairing for my Soave (white wine).  The mains were a corvina fish delicately cooked in wax paper and a swordfish steak served over asparagus with homegrown tomatoes and ""love sauce.""  The corvina came out on the rarer side, perhaps a little too complex for this Midwesterner's palate, but the hearty swordfish was some of the best seafood I've tasted in Missouri.  Dessert comprised a champagne gelatin and a chocolate tart, both of which were topped by fluffy homemade whipped cream and quickly eaten.

The staff at Home Wine Kitchen made our visit pleasant, acting casual yet professional during our meal.  The restaurant patrons seemed to be largely industry types that oohed and aahed about the cuisine (perhaps a trifle self-importantly, but this Yelper is no saint himself).  I was surprised to note that other diners were served the same courses as we were (albeit in different configurations), when I was under the assumption there would be a little more variation; however, I can only imagine the challenge such an endeavor would pose to the talented kitchen.  The interior, lighting, and volume here were all very good.

By the end of the evening, we realized that putting yourself in the hands of the chef is not for the faint of heart, as evidenced by one conversation near us during the meal that all but stopped when a beautiful whole fish was served to the table.  Leaving the restaurant, I was glad that I had tried No Menu Monday, but did wonder what the meal would have been like had I ordered off the menu.  I guess that calls for a return visit, don't you?"
59,"I decided to stop by since I was in the area and craving some authentic Mexican cuisine. I was literally by myself (late lunchtime on a tues) and really excited to try the pazole!! It was delicious ( granted my first and only time) I believe it's pork and has hominy, lettuce, radishes,onions and they give you a small container of dried oregano. Not the biggest fan of the lettuce cause it's gets all wilted but add some hot sauce and it's a meal in itself!!! I got also got the taco lunch special (2 pork tacos and rice) and that was good. Besides the amazing service from the sweet lady, the salsa was way sweet! Wasn't the biggest fan but everything is def fresh! And the pineapple water is a must. I don't like pineapples but I read reviews and just had to try it and thank u guys! Great reviews :) I'm excited to come back to try the burritos esp since I come out here for Costco shopping (soooo close by!) pretty dangerous when I find good food cause then I get cravings :/ enjoy this gem and eat up!!!"
60,"That horrible angst - you want sushi, but you're not SO hungry that you can do AYCE or want to spend $25 for lunch. So we popped in on a weekend for a late lunch and decided to order a la carte.  I ordered a long roll and a hand roll, a drink and a chocolate mochi (OMG, I am officially in love with these things) and the total cost came to just under $20 with tip.  It filled my belly enough so that I was satisfied.  Had I gone for just one more roll, I probably would have broke even with the AYCE, but I probably would've been so stuffed to the point where I wouldn't have needed to eat anything else all day - not the plan for this particular day.

The rolls tasted fresh and delicious, but the surprise was definitely the mochi - so creamy and tasty."
61,"Food was fresh and tasted great, nothing amazing but price was fair and staff was very helpful and nice."
62,"We ate at the bar on a Friday night, where the extremely charming bartender made us the best Manhattans I've ever had, using Carpano Antica Formula vermouth.  We ordered the lamb meatballs, which were okay, and the spring rolls, which were excellent. 

This is a perfect place to stop for a drink in the Quarter, if you need a nice civilized break.  The drinks were extremely expensive, but well worth it for the occasional night out.

The manager, Eric, could not have been more professional and friendly.  We will definitely go back."
63,"Dearest Reader,

Please allow me to hereby confirm the rumors: Village Whiskey does, in fact, have the best burger in Philadelphia. And, I should note, some of the best bartenders. 

As my wife and I sat at the bar waiting for our friends to arrive, I marveled at the infinite selection of whiskeys and bourbons. I decided that this, self, is the day you will begin liking whiskey. So I petitioned the bartender to ""make me something awesome with whiskey in it."" ""What kind of drink do you want?,"" he inquired. ""I have no idea, good sir. You see, I am a neophyte, a tyro, and fledgling when it comes to spirits such as these."" (Perhaps my banter wasn't quite at this level at the time; I was already a few drinks in from my visit to Franklin Mortgage, but this is how I remember it going.) So, he thought about it for a while and proceeded to mix up the craziest drink I had ever seen -- it had whiskey, orange bitters, an egg white, Portuguese red wine, and other stuff in it! The verdict: delicious. I also had the ""The Commodore"" off the drink menu, and it was very good, too. The drinks are a little pricey here, and they will set you back around $11 or $12 each.

When our friends arrived, we were seated outside and I got to try to village burger and the short-rib and cheddar duck-fat fries. The burger, which comes with an artfully restrained dollop of homemade thousand island dressing, was unbelievable. The applewood bacon and the dressing served the elevate the already-incredible taste of the meat. I can't wait to come back and order another one. As for the fries, they were very good, but I think next time I will stick with the plain duck fat fries. Our friends ordered those, and they were super crispy and delicious.

Warning: this place gets insanely busy, so you might have to wait a pretty long time for a table. 

All in all, the drinks were great, the food was delectable, and the staff was very knowledgeable and personable. I would totally come back.

Still dreaming of that burger,
Chris M."
64,"I am from Colorado and am visiting Santa Barbara and let me tell you... what a great place to eat. The food was quality, but the customer service was even better. Also, I thought the price was really good for the amount of food you get. Food came out fast as well. Overall, I'd say it's a great breakfast place if you are in Santa Barbara"
65,"Great location, great food, and friendly staff! There are only a few seats and the store gets pretty crowded with people waiting for their food. I saw a lot of online order ready to go at the counter and think that would be the smart move the next time I want to come during a weekday lunch rush. Weather permitting, it's great to grab some HCV and eat it in Rittenhouse Square across the street! I've come a few times with friends and coworkers and no one has complained about their choices (vegetarians and meat eaters alike)!"
66,"I'm glad that Michael & Lucy found a way to open up another family restaurant after years at Tony's on Linden (now closed following an ugly family dispute). The food is good and the prices are reasonable (ask about the slice and salad special). The Tuscany design is pleasant as are the owners (Lucy is always sweet and friendly). They have local beer on tap (Figueroa, Island Brew and others), 3 HD sports TVs inside, one HD sports TV outside for patio diners, a TV dedicated to surf videos and a TV dedicated to kids shows (and a classic old family friendly Ms Pac-Man game that was a hit with 2 kids when I was there). It's a tough location but I hope they make it work. Santa Claus Lane seems to be having a bit of a Renaissance after many years of being known mostly for outdated kitschy roadside attractions. Good luck!"
67,"Service was a bit slow for Saturday lunch but not unacceptable. Understandable as a new place gets its feet under it. I tried to go Friday night and it was a total mess. Long line and nobody taking names. We left. 

The margarita was great. I had the cilantro chicken enchiladas. Also great! The outdoor seating area was very pleasant under the umbrellas on a lovely Saturday afternoon. 

Overall, I liked it. They just need a bit more time to figure out the flow. I'm thrilled to see something affordable move into my neighborhood. The prices are very reasonable and this place isn't trying to be ""casual fancy"" like the last two train wrecks that occupied this space.

Hope Loco thrives for years to come!"
68,"A definite go-to place if you're in Treasure Island! Love the char-grilled oysters!  Great staff!  Big outdoor seating area and best yet, it's pet friendly so bring your pup!!!  Coming from Austin where pets are accepted everywhere this is a real bonus for me!"
69,"I came here with a group of four and had a great experience. There are tons of interesting appetizers to try--we had dumplings with corn and mushrooms, wings, and some specials that are escaping me. Each of us also got an order of noodles. These are not chinatown noodle house portions, but they also aren't chinatown noodle house ingredients. Interesting, fresh, and tasty. Plus its a great deal and BYO to boot. Great addition to 10th street!"
70,"The Honey Apple grilled cheese sandwich is totally to die for! I never been more happy to eat a grilled cheese sandwich in my life! The staff is friendly, the decor is cool and hip, and the food is great. The Meltdown in Montgomeryville does not compare. The service is rude and the decor is too futuristic/weird. I had my server throw my sandwich at me and splash another customer with soup at Montgomeryville. Regardless of then other shops, I love meltdown it really helps a cheese lover out!"
71,The burgers are amazing! French fries are decent (so get the onion rings).
72,"Food is on point.  I am deducting 1 star for the condition of the bathrooms on the Friday night I went.. Toilet didn't flush, no toilet paper or paper towels and overall gross."
73,"Very tasty sushi and very reasonably priced. Service was quick. 1 specific suggestions for improvement: menu photos

Authentic flavor and ultra healthy"
74,"West Ave. Grill- Its a happy place in Jenkintown with a lot of locals eating outside under umbrellas with their dogs at their feet and kids on their lap.  Inside their is a large and small area with a bar to eat and look past the parking lot to nicer part of Jenkintown town square.  The wait staff is always nice and the owner is often around to talk to.  Free dum dum lolly pops at the counter as you walk out and news papers to read if you are eating alone or want to check in on the Phillies.
Food- always good. Great pancakes that are fluffy and crispy on the edges.  Kansas City  is a great breakfast too- for the most part great.
Big salads could have more Stuff in them- more of the things that are supposed to be there- as described etc.  But a complaint is readily heard and they always try to make you happy.  It's Nice- try it."
75,"We found ourselves in South Tucson needing a good meal from somewhere other than the kitchens of the chain hotels surrounding the airport.  Thank you Yelpers for delivering another great place!

A reconverted 1960's era A & W chain fast food stand [I can detect those old bone shards still!], we enjoyed a wonderful meal at a reasonable price.

I had the catfish smothered in poblano sauce and melted cheese.  They told me it was farm catfish but it tasted like the catfish I used to catch out of a lake near my house as a little kid.  Farm fish never tastes this real.

My wife had chile relleno - fresh peppers, not surprising this time of year but definite kudos to the chef.

The late-stage adolescents with us enjoyed their enhiladas and chimichangas too."
76,"I recently went here with the hubby and a friend and we got the vegetable pakora to start- which was like veggies and hushpuppies all in one- YUM! Then we each got an entree: chicken tikki masala, lamb roganjosh, and lamb vindaloo. Each dish was superb, authentic, and exactly what it should be. The sauces for each were so good I wanted to drink them. Had I saved any room in my tummy, I just might have! 

The place was reasonably priced and the staff/service was just okay. All-in-all, a great addition to Media's varied dinner spots. The lunch buffet looked promising, too, and is only $9.95 on weekdays, $10.95 on wknds."
77,"Great oyster happy hours that go on from 5-7pm! My boyfriend and I shared a dozen oysters and a glass of champagne. Our tab was $24 with tip. Great value! I hear they have the best to-go cups in town, and we totally missed out on that. The staff were very nice and attentive. We almost felt too casual but we felt at home! I'd definitely go back :)"
78,"This is a nice Indian buffet with a pretty wide selection.  There is nothing that will make you say ""wow"", but many good Indian dishes for a very reasonable price.  Would return again."
79,"I definitely preferred the pizza from nabruzzi, but Enzo's is still a good take out option in the area. I recommend their meatball sub and garlic knots. The meatballs taste homemade and of good quality. We'll continue to get food from here, but I do wish they would still offer the pizzas they had when it was nabruzzi"
80,My friends and I all got one of each that were available to try out. I love the many fun donut flavors they have there. The thing that stood out to me was their fried chicken. I got the chicken sandwich and it was SO GOOD. I highly recommend it.
81,"Pricey ( a ham and cheese croissant was $5.50)  as with anywhere in Santa Barbra but very delicious. Cute space ( a bit hard to find ). The green eggs and ham  breakfast biscuit is to die for.  ($10 I think) The Santa Barbra tri tip sandwich was excellent! Cold brew coffee was good. Lots of good choices in the grab and go section, and our salami and pesto sammy was also great. I'd go back!"
82,"One of my most favorite Indian restaurants. Nothing fancy but absolutely delicious meals.

Never an issue being seated promptly. A casual dining experience awaits. Service is pleasant. Ambience a bit blahh but still enjoyable.

Now onto the real reason to come here... the FOOD:
Naan is soft. Garlic is tasty but I usually like the original best.  Regardless of your entree of choice, you really cannot go wrong. And although it does not appeal to my level of spiciness preferred (I like it HOT HOT HOT), it has great flavor and is great for the average spicey food eater. My recommendations are the Masala or Vindaloo (Chicken, Shrimp, Lamb... option is yours). Room for dessert? Order the Rice Pudding  and Gulab Jaman, mix together and enjoy the creamy sugary treat."
83,"I am sort of a simple man, so I had never been to a liquor bar before. I have been to The Libertine twice and had a good experience both times. They use fresh ingredients all the way down to the crushed ice, which they crush with a mallet right at the bar. 

The biggest problem I ran into was figuring out which restroom was the men's. You have to look at the hair on the dimly lit pictures that indicate which is which, all the faces look the same."
84,"This place is hip.  Perhaps too hip for many over 35 but if you can tolerate the boisterous and extremely casually attired youth--I haven't worn a suit in 20 years either but even 20 year olds should have something besides skinny jeans and T-shirts with borderline obscene slogans in their closets--the food is worth it and the staff copes well.   

I had a 6:00 reservation (obtained the day before) but the sky seemed threatening a downpour so I came early to avoid it and was seated 20 minutes or so before the appointed time.  I often don't even make reservations and have no trouble getting seated at popular places by being there when they open or, for those open all day, coming before the popular dinner hour, but that didn't work the day before at Lüke.  Even at 4:30 the place was packed so I did make one for the following day.

My meal started with the crispy Brussel Sprouts.  Even if you hate Brussels sprouts (I like them), don't be afraid to try this dish--if no one told you you might not know what you were eating.  They are in some sort of sweet/sour sauce/dressing and fried both slightly blackened and crispy as advertised . . . tossed with almond slices, small bits of jalapeño and sprinkled with shavings of cheese on top.

Then I had pork schnitzel and ""pommes frites"" (that's shoestring fries to the Galliphobes).  It came with whitish gravy in a pitcher, I suppose to make it ""Southern"".  The gravy was good but I skipped eating it, doing that the usual way with a squeeze of lemon.  It was excellent and the fries were fine too.

I finished with some excellent decaf and a glass of Kahlua--I had had iced tea with the meal so some alcohol was not an excess.

A lady who was some sort of hostess dropped by my table while I was eating to make sure everything was OK and when told I needed ketchup (for the fries), went and got me some (in a dainty little single-serve Heinz bottle).  My waiter also checked several times but didn't hover.

I am giving it 4 stars.  The 5th star is withheld because of the crowded dining room and noise level . . . nothing to do with the food which I greatly enjoyed."
85,"Don't let the outside fool you-this place is much cuter and nicer inside than you would expect! 

Food is good and reasonably  priced. We ordered papaya salad, triple flavor duck, and king tofu soup. Papaya salad is always refreshing, but this place overdoes it on the fish sauce. Anything triple flavor is always a safe but delicious choice. I would say their king soup, with choice of protein, is a winner. 

And also, BYO!"
86,"Good, but expensive. 

We both had steak, and it was pretty darn good. 

The guacamole is nothing special. Yes, it gets made in front of you, but it gets made wrong in my opinion."
87,"I've only eaten here twice and my experience has been great overall. The first time I went, they had just opened. There were some kinks but not anything I would complain about. After all, our group had 8 people so it was understandable. Second time was probably a month later and I noticed they figured out some of the kinks. Their servers are nice and I genuinely felt like they wanted to make my experience great. I know this because every time I made a request the waiter would literally run to get it. I've never seen a server so dedicated, kudos! Honestly most of the stars I'm giving them is because of their genuine service. Added bonus, they were playing Star Trek, hunger games, and iron man. Nice movie selections haha.

The seafood was ok. It's not their fault; it's Tucson so you know you really can't get fresh seafood. That's why I took off a star. They have 1 type of sauce with mild, medium, hot spiciness. It's similar to angry crab's ""trifecta"" or boiling crab's, ""the whole shabang"" but with an Asian twist. It was good in my opinion.

Lastly, if anyone has ever gone to angry crab, hot n juicy, boiling crab, should know that the price range is similar. Heck, if anyone has ever bought raw seafood at the store should know that it is on the expensive side. Expensive? Yes. Overpriced? No. I have been to many seafood places similar to this and it's a decent price for what you get. My advice for the Dungeness crab, since it did happen to me at other places and I saw a review on it here, is to share it or get their other selections that they can measure out. The dungeness crab is a full crab so finding a 1 lb dungeness crab is not common. 

Would recommend and go again."
88,Nice new burger spot downtown! They are apart of the harry & izzys chain. The burgers are pretty good. You do have to order a side separately which kinda sticks but seems to be a trend these days. They take reservations so that's always a plus. If you are looking for additional options besides a burger might not be your best spot to go. I'd like to see them do a lunch special during the week for those that go during the work day. I think it would help with costs and getting a bigger lunch crowd. Overall great experience and service. Check them out!
89,"I think if I could, I would give Zen Yai a 3.5 stars, but alas, c'est la vie. 

The prices for their curry are excellent, at less than $12. Zen Yai is a tiny place, which is both good and bad. Good if you don't have to wait, because it is nice and cozy, but bad if enough people eat here on a given evening -- because you may just have to wait a while.

I like the decor a lot, and the use of colors. The tables and plates are full of refreshingly bright colors. 

The service was fine, and the food was at our table in no time.

My Pineapple curry was excellent! And the rice is served in the shape of a pyramid, which is fun. 

All that being said, my girlfriend had a less than pleasurable experience. She is a seasoned green curry lover, and was disappointed with their green curry offering."
90,"Great rolls and sake. We sat in the bamboo room, which definitely added to the experience, if you are able and agile."
91,"I stopped in to order take out and get a drink while I waited since it was happy hour. I am usually a beer drinker but I decided to step out of my comfort zone and ordered the dragonberry iced tea which was refreshing but not obnoxiously cocktail-ly, very pleasant. I had lemongrass chicken and crab rangoon, the lemon grass chicken and rice was fantastic. I do wish the crab rangoon had a little more filling but the dipping sauce was great. I've been here a few times and I have never been disappointed in the food or the service."
92,Large menu. Clean restaurant and restroom. Friendly staff. They were fairly busy in the middle of the day when we visited. This was my first time here and all we had was a sandwich so I can't give them 5 stars yet but for a family style restaurant and bar we enjoyed our meal. They had a decent draft beer selection and also serve wine and mixed drinks. There are crayons on every table and instead of a single place mat they put a large sheet of white paper on the tables for the kids to draw on.
93,"Delicious crab cocktail and my husband loved his steamers. 

Only down fall is it is really humid in the restaurant itself. A fan would be nice."
94,Great pizza! The place is beautiful and the atmosphere is truly inviting. The service is very nice and fast.
95,"Had a great breakfast here last weekend before we headed out. You order at the front and they will bring the food out. I had the French toast (fruit on the side)  with an a la carte fried egg on the side. They dropped my egg when they got to the table but promptly brought out another one. I also had a vanilla latte which was yummy....no extra sweeteners needed. 

We sat outside on the patio which was just lovely. Even if you sat inside, like other restaurants in the French quarter, every door and windows are open, so fresh breezes flow throughout. Really nice experience."
96,In my book you can never go wrong having a good old-fashioned meal a Johnny Rockets. I had their recent promo which was a barbecued pulled pork burger. It was a lot of food and a lot of flavor!! Top that with endless fries and I'm a happy camper. Have never had a bad experience at this location. They were recently moved from the casino floor level to the shopping level and since they did that they don't do the singing or dancing anymore which is a shame
97,"Above average steaks - great service - excellent wine list.  Comparable to Ocean Prime, Ruth's Chris."
98,"The pizza was the best we've had in the Fairmount/Art Museum/Brewerytown area and we've probably tried 5 or so.  The pepperoni was a little crispy (good thing) and the wings were, too.  That last one is really surprising since there are so many soggy wings out there.  Lazos does it right.  They gave me Sprite instead of Coke but otherwise this was a very good pizza+wing combo.  Will order again!"
99,"Old school decor - dark woods and copper tile ceiling (real?)  I was there for the express lunch, a good deal.  You get a choice of soup with the entree of the day.  The gumbo and crab bisque were spot on. Gumbo - rich with the andouille sausage adding just a bit of heat. Crab bisque - flavored with old bay style seasoning but not overly salty and just a bit of shredded crab. The entree was a garganelli with roast pork ragu, mushrooms and creole tomatoes.  The sauce was light and blended the flavors well.  The roast pork highlighted the dish - fork tender, caramelized and left me wanting more."
100,"I like it. The atmosphere is festive and there is a nice variety of music in Spanish. Service is attentive and they got my picky order straight.

It was a boring salad made with iceberg lettuce that could easily be improved by using romaine or something darker. My more culinary friend ordered the chicken soup and swears it is one of the best he has tasted. And this guy knows food. He is the type of person that has a hog slaughtered and knows what to do with the meat.

So it's a great place to go for chicken soup, and I heard the queso fundido is pretty darn good as well. Although it was recommended you order just the queso, and if you want chorizo, ask for it on the side because otherwise it gets a little greasy."
101,"We stopped by a couple of weeks ago for Sunday brunch.  The food was very good and filling.  Nice drinks, and we had a very pleasant server.  Cool cafe space.  Overall a good recommend."
102,"A friend of mine took me to this little jewel near Dale Mabry and it was a great time. Its a small place with under 12 tables and a sushi bar. The bar seems to be the place to sit for the entertainment value. The sushi chefs (and owner) are pretty chatty and always say hi to everyone that comes in. It has a very friendly feel. We ended up at a table because the bar was full. I had pretty average fare in a spicy tuna roll and a rainbow roll, a couple pieces of yellow tail, and 2 pieces of Wahoo. It was all done very well! Super fresh and tasty. The sticky rice wasnt all that sticky and I ended up with a bowl fill of soy sauce and rice by the end of it, but that Wahoo...whoa....that Wahoo!! Just try it and you wont be disappointed. I spent about $30 for dinner which was a fine price for what I got and I will certainly be back for more!"
103,"The great customer service that you get here, you won't find in another to-go Asian/Thai restaurant. I enjoyed the food! The curry had great flavor and consistency. The shrimp fried rice does not look appealing but it is flavorful and fluffy. I dropped it down to 4 stars because I paid an additional $2.00 for extra egg and it was NOT extra egg. I also called in my order and received a 30 minute wait time. Total wait time was an hour. With all that being said, the ladies won me over with their passion to serve those waiting and making sure each customer was happy!"
104,"Went recently for a birthday party and it was certainly worth checking out.   Was my first time there and I was pleased for sure.  

Was nice and quiet as it was a Tuesday and the service was good because of that.  I'm sure it normally is though based on the size of the place.  

I had beef n lobster which both were cooked well and I was happy.  Also the mashed and asparagus that came with it were both very good.  

I wasn't to stoked with the appy we had which was these crab and cheese balls as they were very bland with little crab taste and no real seasoning it seemed.  Maybe just not for me but I wouldn't recommend those. 

Also had Creme Brule which was solid and is get it again for sure.  

Overall I'd say four due to a couple things like the appy and the shaky table, seriously so stupid to have that at a place that nice.  

But I'd gladly go again and would tell friends to try it."
105,"Based this visit entirely upon previous Yelp reviews, which as usual we're spot on. Great atmosphere and feel to this place - Kind of an art house meets coffee house meets Animal House environment. Very unusual. In a good way. The service was relaxed, social and great. The beverages were delicious and the menu was quite interesting. 
I so wanted the food to be much better than it was. Tried the Bird and Pig, a specialty grilled cheese and a couple apps. Everything was good but not great. In truth, if I was judging on food alone, there would be three stars instead of four. But the atmosphere and the staff clearly deserved the extra star, and I'll head back to try some other items on the menu next visit."
106,"I like this place.  Unique sandwiches, and it's definitely the best place to go if you want a healthy option or have vegan friends."
107,Great happy hour.  And brunch.  Only had dinner there once and it was only OK- probably because I ordered something I don't typically eat.  It'll definitely try it again.
108,"I ate at Puckett's yesterday for lunch, and I have to say it was some mighty tasty food for an old-fashioned meat-and-three.  But I actually had a meat-and-two!  Definitely check out the squash casserole.  it was quite the tasty dish.  I'd also recommend their meatloaf, which is what I had.

My only complaint--and it's a minor one--is that they advertise cornbread.  Yes, it's cornbread, but not a slice of cornbread like you typically think of it.  People in the North would call it a corn fritter.  Being from KY, I'd call it a hoe cake.  It's cornbread but more like a cornbread pancake."
109,"We had a 2 1/2 day corporate conference here in the middle of June. The service was excellent, the facilities were very nice and I was fairly impressed with catering. Great spot for conferences or small conventions. Close to the airpor with a complimentary shuttle and complimentary parking."
110,"Went there for lunch and was pleasantly surprised, as having recently moved to Tampa from Los Angeles, I have been disappointed by the food.  However, I give Ploy Thai 4 stars, not just by Tampa standards, but by good food standards.  The food was very flavorful and the ingredients very fresh."
111,This are awesome and so good! I love the BBQ pork one the best. The staff is so friendly. This is my first dive into Vietnamese cuisine and now I def. want to try more! The bubble tea is so good. I am glad there is another place in town to get the bubble tea. I never tried it before and I love it! They have fresh rolls that taste just as good as sit down Thai restaurants. I love that they will add extra jalapenos and usually not charge extra. They are fresh not pickled and sometimes has seeds which makes it even spicier which is good!! GO NOW! TO BAGUETTE DELI!!
112,"Another gem on Frenchmen.  We made it in just in time to grab the corner tall table and enjoyed the piano player playing some nice tunes.

Order at the bar and they'll bring you the food.  What we had:
pork pot stickers - pretty good - $4 HH price
smoked hanger steak w/ chimichurri sauce on toastones - tasted much better than it looked - $4 HH price
lobster eggrolls w/ sweet chile lime sauce - $8 - didn't look promising but it was tasty
Hopitoulas - $4.5
UFO - $4.5

One of the owners/chefs is Korean, thus the Asian food.

HH everyday from 4-6:30pm, $4 tapas, $5 wines, $3 beers.

We will definitely return."
113,"We had a very nice dinner here on St. Patrick's day, which happens to be my sister's birthday.  The server was super sweet and served the cake we brought to celebrate.  The bartender was so kind and gave my sister a complimentary St. Patty's cocktail, which was incredibly yummy.  

We ordered various dishes:  tri-tip, rotisserie chicken, pulled pork and a veggie burrito.  All was wonderful, except for the veggie burrito, which was lackluster (but who orders a veggie burrito at a rotisserie grill???).  My father-in-law has visited many more times, raving about the moist, flavorful rotisserie chicken.  

The prices were reasonable, portions adequate and service super!  We will definitely visit again, minus the resident vegetarian.  :)"
114,"Went to see Anders Osborne play here & it was a highlight of my trip to NOLA.  Streetcar went straight down to Bourbon after the show but I wish I'd stayed longer! Food smelled awesome, drinks were very reasonably priced  & the crowd was mellow."
115,Rons still a regular stop for me.  Usually some good craft beers  (excellent this week) and tasty food  (if you know what to stick with on menu).
116,"Not mediocre at all IMHO.  Makes me wonder if Daniel O. went to the same place we did.

This is a great neighborhood byob place that provides welcoming service and excellent food at a reasonable price.  We started going here because numerous South Philly friends recommended it.  This is not foo-foo Italian.  This is not pretentious Italian.  This is ""let's go back and work our way through the menu"" Italian.  We found the specials to be good choices.  My husband's broccoli rabe and sausage was excellent, as was a grilled romaine salad with bleu cheese and pine nuts.  Both were generous enough to share.  Last time, sausage & figs was a hit.  If you are in the mood for a basic plate of macaronis with red gravy, you won't be disappointed either.  We had a great time with the waitress because my BIL brought a bottle of Great Wall wine from China (that was the 2nd bottle we opened) and that started a whole crazy discussion.  She didn't know us from Adam, but we left there feeling like regulars.

It's a very doable destination if you are on your way to a sporting event at the Linc or the Cit, or to the Spectrum or Wachovia Center.  For those who rely on public transportation, you can get off the subway at Broad & Oregon, then walk back a block to Broad & Porter.  Make a reservation, though because it can be a popular place.  You also want to make sure you have time to have a relaxing meal and make your event in time."
117,"My brother and I ate here to celebrate my college graduation and I must say I was very satisfied. Great vibes in the restaurant, our waiter was outstanding, and the food was delish."
118,"If you are looking to be impressed by French-German dishes in New Orleans, please go to Luke Restaurant, I know I was. 

The restaurant is located in the Central Business District, next to the Hilton and in the former Masonic Temple Building, so there is that historic vibe to the restaurant. The front room is a lot more grand than the back room (where we were seated), but that is offset by views of the open kitchen. 

Apparently they only want to seat people with reservations, so since we did not have one, we were refused seating until 9:15pm (it was 6:45pm) but with a little back and forth, we ended up waiting only 15 minutes before we were seated. However, as we walked through the restaurant to the back room, way too many tables were empty that it made no sense that they acted that way. A lot of tables still remained empty throughout the meal.

I decided to start out my meal with a cocktail. I originally wanted the Mint Julep but they were out so I had the Riverbend (vodka, lemon juice, basil syrup, blueberries & ginger ale) at the recommendation of the server. It was a relatively sweet cocktail, with the ginger ale being the most powering flavor, but you could still taste the alcohol.

My friend choose a regular starter and ordered a cup of the Crawfish Bisque. She ate all of it so I am assuming she liked it, but she did complain of a sour aftertaste.

My boyfriend skipped the appetizers and went straight for the entree. He always seems to find the most basic item on the menu and order it. He had the Luke Burger (bacon, caramelized onions, tomatoes, Swiss cheese) and was raving about it. One thing I can tell you, it was a very good size. 

My friend had the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp ""En Cocotte"" with lump crab meat, roasted jalapeño cheese grits, andouille & green onion sausages. She loved it.

I have an obsession with mussels so I had the classic Moules et Frites. Although only having two simply ingredients (garlic & thyme) in the broth, the flavors stood out and the taste was a lot bolder than others I have had with a lot more ingredients. The house-made fries were scrumptious. These are the best kind.

Even with all that food, we still made room for dessert. We first had the Bread Pudding which was delicious but quite sweet. I am also not a fan of over sauced foods.

One wasn't enough so we also ordered the Bourbon Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee. It was superb and not too sweet which is a plus for me. The little cookies on top added nothing to the dessert and if anything could have been left off.

All that good food, I still have to give props to our server. He was amazing and engaging. The front desk soured the mood a little bit a first but he more than made up for it. I couldn't have asked for anyone better."
119,"I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance. The decor was modern and cozy. The lighting was appropriate for dinner but terrible for selfies lol. Our waiter was OK. He seemed to be very hyper and impatient. I almost felt like he was rushing to take care of us instead of genuinely trying to give us an experience. I ordered the Shrimp Breaux Bridge and it was tasty. Nothing to phone home about but it was good. My friend ordered the Balsamic Salmon and it was good as well. It kind of reminded me of an Asian dish. Another friend had the Pesto Crusted Idaho Trout. It was cooked and flavored very nicely. 

I also ordered the Zangria White which is a sangria that was supposed to include strawberries, blueberries and diced apples... and i only got apples. IF there is an item on the menu that contains SEASONAL FRUITS AND VEGGIES ETC.... DISCLOSE SOMEWHERE ON THE MENU THAT THOSE THINGS ARE OUT OF SEASON. It definitely wouldve made a difference in my drink order. But overall the sangria was OK. 

I would go back because Im sure the service is better that what I experienced and I have heard amazing things about the menu."
120,"Excellent food and bar. Slow service.

A friend and I stopped here during an evening of bar hopping in the CBD. We were seated promptly and given our menus, which are half-French, half-English. Not a big deal for anyone who can read French and/or has been living in Louisiana for a reasonable amount of time, but definitely something tourists should be wary of. I didn't have any alcohol because I was the designated driver, but I can say that their drink menu is extensive, and the bar was packed from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. 

This restaurant's biggest strength is it's food. I tasted their crab bisque, and had Poulet Grand-Mère as my entrée. Both were excellent. The latter arrived in a wide cast-iron bowl, which I'm sure has a more proper name, but was an interesting touch nonetheless.

The service was why I gave this restaurant 4/5 instead of 5/5. Most of the wait staff seemed to be interns from culinary school. The handful we dealt with were very friendly, but would do well to be a little more attentive. For example, the server who brought us our desserts ran off before we could ask for spoons to eat the dessert with. 

In summary, a good dining experience, but I think I would rather continue exploring new restaurants in the area before returning."
121,"Came here for Sunday brunch and walked away with a very full belly and a good buzz! 

Their brunch buffet includes tons of seafood, an omelet station, pasta bar, carving station, custom sushi rolls, fresh fruit, salads, and the usually breakfast foods you'd expect at a buffet. I almost forgot dessert...an entire side of the room is dedicated to a table full of desserts AND a chocolate fountain. The brunch price also include bottomless mimosas which were literally bottomless. Our server never let us empty our glasses and  the mimosas were very heavy on the champagne, so we all got a bit tipsy. At least the alcohol let us forget how much weight we gained during this meal.

As if the buffet spread wasn't enough, they also have an a la carte menu with small dishes. The choices included Belgian waffles, french toast, blintzes, Mahi, and a few other savory dishes.  You can order as many of these items as you want, as many times as you want. Our server was sure to remind us of this, she seemed to enjoy watching how gluttonous our table was! 

Unfortunately we were here during Tropical Storm Debby, so we didn't get to enjoy a beautiful view of the bay, Although, being here while the weather was so awful was very cozy with the fireplace and wood interior. Thanks to the weather it wasn't crowded either, so don't write this place off on account of bad weather. 

At $35 a person, the Sunday brunch seems pricey, but if you have no qualms about overeating and overdrinking, you'll definitely get your money's worth."
122,"We had a very nice brunch here. The food was consistently quite good and the service was pretty efficient and courteous. The omelets were sumptuous, the beverages fun (including a bloody mary bar.. we did have to ask for fresh bacon as it had run out). 

I did the budget breakfast which hit the spot with scrambled eggs, roaster taters, and a sweet muffin. The fish tacos were also good. Nice al fresco dining on the patio."
123,"I would eat anything they served me. I haven't even had the pancakes yet and I'm sold. The line out the front door and down the sidewalk should be an indication that this place is awesome. I just had basic hashbrowns eggs and bacon, but it was so fab and the service was great! I will definitely go back and sit down to eat. Parking is a little difficult around there, but that's to be expected."
124,"My son and I went in for burgers after a long day's drive returning him to Nashville for the upcoming semester. We were in need of immediate sustenance after a long fast. What we found was a busy place that actually knew how to operate with a full house. Our need were quickly satisfied with courteous and reasonably priced service. 

Since we were just two, we were quickly seated. We started off with a couple Highland stouts. It was a nice drink and at a reasonable price. Before our entree, we shared a large garden salad. It was fresh and flavorful. The dressing was a bit on the heavy side for a vinaigrette. 

For entrees, I had the Black and Blue burger with fries. The burger was just incredible. It was perfectly cooked. The blue cheese was not overpowering. The bun was soft and fresh. The side of regular fries were crisp and lightly salted. Even better, they went perfectly with the homemade ketchup. I'm not a fan of ketchup, but theirs is very nice since they seem to avoid adding too much sweetness. My son had a basic burger with sweet potato fries. I tried the sweet potato fries and think they might be some of the best I've ever eaten. The burger looked as good as mine and my son concurred. 

The burger was well made and consumed within minutes. No words were spoken as we ate. Always a good sign. We shall return."
125,"Great food and excellent service. Only knock I would give them was they brought out our entrees about 10 minutes after our apps came so we were still eating that, otherwise great experience"
126,"Use the yelp app to get on the waiting list, we went on a Saturday morning and it was very busy, but the waiting list was cut down significantly by using the app. The menu is expansive, a lot of options. The cinnamon French toast was very good. The traditional breakfast foods were on par with most breakfast joints, but the extras on the menu can keep you busy for many visits trying new things. The strawberry orange juice was excellent so I recommend trying it. It was a little hot in the restaurant, could have been cooled down a lot for a more comfortable experience. The service was very good. There were two places to pay at the counter which I thought was a nice way to speed up the leaving process."
127,"Cute place, nice servers and good food but dish sizes are waaaaay too small. I left unsatisfied. I don't like it when restaurants are cheap with portions, especially neighborly ones!"
128,"This is a great late brunch option during the weekends when the big morning rush dies down after 1 pm. Usually there is no wait or 5 minute wait at this time. One big complaint is that they don't have an organized system for seating guests. The servers don't always greet incoming patrons (which should be required Waffle House-style) and they sometimes tell you to seat yourself (which can lead to one or two people taking up tables for 4) or they'll seat you (whenever they get around to talking to you). 

I've ordered a several different dishes at this point and they have varies from ok to awesome. The chicken wings and onion rings are just ok. The wings are either lightly dredged in flour or not at and then fried whole. They aren't really seasoned so the wings are pretty bland. The ""onion rings"" made of formed, chopped onions that are breaded. The chicken fingers were a bit over battered and dry. The smashwich (or whatever it's called) was pretty good: your choice of breakfast meat with hash browns and eggs in a hoagie roll, but unspectacular. The club sandwich is classic diner fare that is very well executed. The egg and omelette platters are a very good deal and dang tasty. The best thing on the menu is definitely the waffle. It's gently sweet, very crispy and covered in butter. So good!

The service is generally pretty attentive (once you're seated), the restaurant and bathrooms are very clean, the food is a good, tasty value"
129,"I would give them 5 but I was disappointed by their reuben.  
For some reason, I have to order reuben if it is a new place and the place has a reuben on their menu. 
but the reuben's rye bread was disappointing considering that companion is all about the bread.  

However, my fiancee's sandwich(forgot the name) with chicken, bacon, avocado on french bread was amazing!

had their spice chicken soup with their corn bread.  It was great! the soup had tons of vegetables and chicken, just the right amount of heat and the corn bread is pretty big and delicious.  

their chi latte was not impressive.. do not get it. lol 

little pricey but, it's a great place to have a wonderful breakfast/lunch and the workers are nice and friendly. 

check this place out, let me know what you guys think."
130,"I would give it 5 stars but I when I look at my rating dispersion I realize I might be a little generous.  While all I had here was Oysters they were spectacular.

Ask for Kentrelle at the Oyster Bar and have him make you the ""firecracker.""  It will blow you doors off."
131,"When giving friends from out of town a tour of the French Quarter, one can only expect they want some classic New Orleans dishes. I've been here a couple of times, but they were the ones that wanted to go, due to their lunch special. It's a nice, well know restaurant that offers a 17.00 lunch special that includes a soup or salad, entree, and the option for a 4.00 Bloody Mary or martini. I got the Bloody Mary and it was a great size for the price. It was spicy and hit the spot.
They text message you when your table is ready, so were able to walk around the quarter while we waited. Thank god a lot of restaurants are getting rid of the those buzzers that make you feel like you are under house arrest. 
We sat down to a beautiful table right by the open shutters. The servers, were ok. They were busy, but forgot a couple of things we asked for. It was still a great experience though!
I got the pork chop with red beans and the turtle soup. The turtle soup was one of the best I have had. The pork chop was cooked to perfection and the read beans were seasoned very well. It came with cornbread, but it was very dry. After this lunch at noon, I didn't find myself hungry till it was basically time for bed. It was a very generous portion and well worth the money.

Muriel's is a great way to get a classic, good quality New Orleans meal at a decent price. The location is spectacular, and the history behind the restaurant made for great conversation at the table.
Definitely check it out if you are in the Quarter!"
132,"Delicious! 

I wish they took reservations, but my friend and her fiance go there nice and early so that we could snag a seat inside (it was cold out!). 

We ordered the bianco salad ( to share between 2) and the western addition (to share between 4).

I thought the salad was tasty but nothing special, despite the white chocolate shavings. Cute idea, but not enough crunch or pizazz to make the salad seem really fabulous.

The pizza, however, was pretty darn good. We ordered it deep dish to try their special cornmeal crust and were pretty impressed. 
The crust tastes a little bit like cornbread, a little bit like pizza dough, a tiny bit like grease (the good kind) and a lot like YUM!

I don't know if it was the best pizza I've ever had, but it was very good. It would be even better if it were a tad cheaper, and didn't get so crowded! But definitely worth a visit if you're in the area!"
133,"Very nice employes very resonable price. Excellent homemade salad dressing. Good food, an all around good italian resturant."
134,"I heard alot about Honey's and how the food is so good here. I chose today my birthday to be my first visit .I read earlier reviews about how crowded it gets and they were not lying but I didn't wait no more than 20 minutes. Now let's get down to the food it was delicious. I had french toast, home fries, sausage and for dessert a slice of Jewish apple cake and it was to die for! I will be back most definitely."
135,"Everything great about a jewish deli, southern comfort joint and a bit of mexican dive restaurant all mixed together. Brisket is good, but don't expect a tomato based sauce. Latke is not a normal round one, but super delicious. I also took the Jewish Apple Cake to go and despite being a little too brown on the bottom, it was delicious even 3 hours later on my flight back to LA."
136,"We tried this place for the first time last night. Being a Saturday night during March Madness the service was a bit slow. The complimentary chips took longer to get to the table than my husband's salad did. Thankfully they had one of the nearby televisions playing a kid's movie to keep my 3 year old happy. Back to the chips, they are home made and were fantastic. I went the safe route and ordered a burger with seasoned fries. It was wonderful. My husband ordered the blackened chicken and while it was good it was a little over seasoned making it a tad too spicy. My daughter had the kid's macaroni and cheese. It looked wonderful but she couldn't stop eating the chips, LoL. The seating inside was a bit weird. There is a table about 2ft from the door to the women's bathroom. Maybe I'm weird for thinking it's weird but I ended up waiting until I got home to go. They offer a 15% military discount which was great. 

Overall I'd definitely recommend this place. I would have given it 5 stars if the service had been a little better."
137,"I have been coming to Cd Roma's for over 10 years. I love this place! The old locations was a bit more home style feeling and cozy and the new spot has a more modern vibe to it. I applaud the change in style with the change in times. Too many places get stuck doing the same thing over and over again. I am glad to see that the food is still delicious. The Chicken Parm, Eggplant Parm, house salad and Alfredo are some of my favorites and they have great pizza. The alfredo sauce is made to order and taste amazing with their breadsticks. Some appetizer items leave something to be desired like the frozen cheesesticks or calimari. I would love to see these replaced with better quality items. Overall, I still love this place and would choose it over Olive Garden any day. I do miss the homey old school vibe from the old location but I also miss the good old days when people talked to each other, fragglerock ruled and hip hop was Wu Tang Clan. Oh well...."
138,"The Waffle House has consistent quality wherever you go. I'm not really fond of their business model with their yelling and very small dining area, but I get it. 
I still look forward to going for breakfast."
139,"Great place for lunch in NOLA. Love their fried chicken, and the red beans and rice is yummy too. It's a staple on our trips to town. Staff is friendly and attentitve and prices are great."
140,"My first experience did mot go well due to the heavy accents of the employees. I called ahead so my order would be ready for me to pick up and it was, it just was not what I ordered. They are nice people and corrected my order but instead of simply picking up my food I had to wait 20 minutes To get my original order. When all was said and done, the food was good.

I was nearby and decided to give them a second chance. This time I ordered a pizza steak and I was really impressed! I need to have a couple more before I can declare them my new favorite pizza steak. Plenty of mozzarella cheese and the roll is stuffed with meat and just enough sauce. It's looking like this place is a lot better than my first impression."
141,"Four stars for the beer, atmosphere and usually service. There is a reason this place is always packed! Half price beer during a generous happy hour, a huge deck that welcomes dogs, and delicious key lime pie.   Sadly, said deck allows smoking, and there is usually lots of it. I wish they at least had a nonsmoking side. 

If giving a review just based on the food, I would give it a two. The pretzels are ok, but the cheese dip is Velveeta nastiest. As a native Wisconsinite, I take offense at plastic cheese. Then, there's the pretzel bun sandwiches. I've sampled the chicken, brat and Italian sausage. It's pricey, considering it comes with potato chips (seriously guys?! Get a fryer!) and just ok. The buns were kind of soggy and the overall experience underwhelming, especially knowing the epic sandwiches for sale next door. I wish the Village pub would focus on what it's best that, serving beer, and let us bring Mitchell's sandwiches over."
142,Food and atmosphere is nice. As one should expect in the CBD. Sometimes the back room can be stuffy on a busy day. I recommend the raw oysters and burgers. A few dollars on the high side for lunch.
143,"The hot chicken is probably one of the best fried chickens I've ever eaten, and I'm from the South/NC and have had quite a bit of it. However, the price for the small portion size is really expensive. The drinks here are fantastic too."
144,"I finally made it to Farmhaus last Saturday, and it was worth the wait.  

As expected for a weekend, it was crowded.  We arrived about 15 minutes early and had to wait on the bench back by the bathrooms for a few minutes.  However, as I said, we were earlier than they anticipated, and they got us to the bar as soon as seats opened up.  They wisely gave us a copy of the menu to be prepared once we were seated, and we did indeed plan our entire meal in advance.  This was helpful, because we were actually seated about 20 minutes late, and I was about to eat the menu itself as I drooled over the descriptions!  

The smoked fish dip and escolar with prawns were fantastic- the standouts of the meal.  The mushroom salad and tapenade were also very good.  The meatloaf was good, but a little on the dry and bland side.  I wanted to get the nachos, but there were no other takers in my group....next time....

Service was good.  It was a bit shaky at times, but it was slammed the whole time we were there and that small space must be tough to work in.  

I would love to go back and check out their blue place special lunches...I have heard amazing reviews.  I think I will head back for dinner when there is outdoor seating, as I think that would add to the experience."
145,This restaurant was pretty good; i'll admit it! I went here in the late evening with my boyfriend to have a nice date! He insisted on us ordering a milkshake and i'm SO GLAD that he did. The milkshake was probably one of the best ones i've had in my lifetime. The food was pretty good and so was the service but something was a little off. I couldn't tell what it was but i just got a really strange vibe from the restaurant. Maybe i'm just being crazy!
146,"Dayum, that was a good burger. Juicy, glistening melting with cheese - simplistic yet tastes completely different from other burger joints due the quality of the ingredients. Bacon looks good in pictures, but it was a too thick of slice of puuuure white fat, if it would have melted in my mouth it would have worked but it didn't therefore just felt sinful, in a bad way. 

Unfortunately, this communal table trend has got to go. 
I hate it, it's a crap shoot on who your going to get to sit next to and basically listen to a complete strangers stupid conversations. Terrible idea."
147,"Looking for a delicious New Year's Day brunch was hard this year in New Orleans. We didn't want to wait in line and wanted instant gratification. Although we may have felt tired, my bf and I were appropriately dressed to go to Mr. B's. As soon as we walked in, I felt transported into a different world. Jazz music was playing and I felt at home. 

First of all, I could not have been more grateful for the fresh loaf of bread we were given. We devoured it in a matter of minutes. Then came the gumbo ya-ya. It was spicy and savory and everything I expected from a gumbo. Finally came the bbq shrimp. We had been warned that these shrimp did come with their heads and tails on. Bibs were placed around our necks and we were off. The shrimp were some of the most rich and delicious ones I have ever tasted. The sauce they were served with was divine. Although it was messy, there is no other dish on the menu I would have traded for this.

Overall, service was friendly and quick at Mr. B's. The food was delicious, although a little pricey. Definitely try the brunch if you are able to."
148,"Nice Steakhouse in St. Louis. We went here for a client dinner and was pleasantly surprised. You get a nice view of the arch on the way in to the restaurant as well. 

The Apps were OK. We ended up getting the Carmine's trio (crab cakes, scallops and toasted ravioli). Crab cakes were above average. The scallops were a little saccharine for my tastes but the ravioli was good; and let's face it...one doesn't come to St. Louis for the scallops. Thankfully the filet mignon was exceptional. It was the perfect size, not too salty and rare just like I had requested. 

This was partnered with an above average wine list to make a great night out."
149,"I've been here twice now and sampled a bunch of what they have to offer - I feel like what you order will really dictate how much you like this place.  i.e. they do some things great and other things just so-so.

The two things I will surely go back for more of is the Sausage and Pepper Pizza (capitalized - because I mean business) and some sort of puff pastry that has a white cream in the middle - I'm sure it has a name but it escapes me.  The pizza was perfectly flavored and the sausage/peppers had a nice kick to it.  Im sure it would make for great leftovers but unfortunately (fortunately?) for me it was gone well before it found the refrigerator.  The cream puff cream was just awesome - couldn't pin-point the flavor (vanilla?) but I would prefer it to top every dessert I get from this point forward.

I also got a bunch of the other sweets (salted brownie, blondie, red velvet crumb-cake) and a few bagels.  All were good, but not great.  Was pleasantly surprised by the wheat everything bagels - whole wheat bagels usually suck.

What I didn't really like was the pepperoni pizza.  It was pretty bland for my liking - in complete contrast to the sausage and pepper pizza - and the pepperoni was pretty sparse. I also didn't like being told 25 minutes, showing up in 25 minutes and then standing there for 25 minutes waiting for the pizza.  The small shop + no chairs = awkwardly standing there for almost a half hour.  

Since it's close to me and has so many tasty looking treats yet to try - I'll surely be back.  Hopefully I'll get more 'great' than 'so-so'."
150,"Went for Dinner at 6pm on a Friday and expect it to be packed, luckily for us, it wasn't. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is straight out of Magnolia Journal. The food was pretty dang good and drinks are too. The only reason I left off a star was the fact it took a little while to get our cocktails and our appetizer came at the same time as our food. But, they're new and I've been in hospitality before, so I get it!"
151,"We had an excellent lunch here. The food was great and the service was fantastic. Great Gumbo Ya Ya, great BBQ shrimp, delicious crab cakes. Everything we tried was good. I highly recommend this place."
152,"As a fan of the late night kabab, shwarma or gyro in nyc, I made a stop through Ali ba ba's on one occasion and ended up here again near the end of the trip as it hits the spot!  They are bigger in size of the ones I get in NYC and double the price ($6) but I can imagine the cost is a factor of limited demand (small lines) and pallets in NOLA for a gyro vs a po boy.  They only have rooster sauce for hot sauce which is a knock and they can be slow to serve but the gyros are better than the $5 slice next door or the $5+ lucky dogs on the corner."
153,"BBQ Chicken Sandwich only $5.75? Nice. Chicken was nicely grilled, your choice of topppings / sacues, pretty neat.


Grilled sourdough, wheat bun or white bun -- quite a few options to choose from, at a great price."
154,Sooooo good!!! I prefer to take out and I have never actually picked up myself so I have no idea besides what I am told on how the dining experience is... Basically very Bosnian /Bosnian people in the restaurant... But who doesn't like diversity? And that's all I was told also I heard its pretty clean! Cheers to this place for making awesome gyros!
155,"3.50 stars.  

Gabby's wasn't open.  I knew that.  Neither was Rotier's.  But my handy Yelp app had assured me that Fido's was open.  Imagine the disappointment when I realized there was a very real possibility that no burgers would happen on this trip down to the Deep South.  Would I really have to wait two more weeks when I would find solace in East Texas?   

""We can try Burger up,"" I mentioned.  

""Why don't you just call them?"" hissed the appropriately nicknamed Viper.  

True.  We didn't have to keep driving around aimlessly.  So I call Burger Up, and a very pleasant, sweet voice assures me they are indeed open.  

Viper: ""What was her name?  She sounded hot.""
  
Me: ""Paige.""

Viper: ""Yeah, she's definitely hot.  Have you ever met an unattractive Paige?""

Me: ""Good point.  At least we have that going for us.""

Paige was indeed attractive, but this review isn't about a photogenic individual who happens to work at Burger Up.  It's about what ended up being a visit to our fourth choice for burgers in Nashville.  

Burger Up follows a national trend towards upscale burgers.  My particular order consisted of a medium rare patty served with aged cheddar, Benton's bacon (very good), and ketchup served on an artisan bun.  Basically, it was a gussied up bacon cheeseburger, but it was a rather tasty one.  My major complaint is that I wish the actual meat itself exhibited more flavor.  Having said that, the burger was cooked properly and the flavors worked well together.  I ordered some wilted spinach on the side (mediocre) and truffle fries.  Let's talk about those truffle fries for a bit.  I know more people are apparently into the sweet potato fries here, but I think they are missing the boat.  Burger Up's truffle tries have pleasant aroma, taste great, and are the perfect texture for soaking up oil.  If you are on a diet, it is true you should skip these delightful fries.  But if that were the case, why are you at a burger joint in the first place?  Seriously, if you get nothing else out of my review, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries.  

Burger Up also boast an interesting beer menu with semi-obscure breweries from the Deep South included in the list.  I tried a pecan-infused amber from Mississippi - not bad.  I could imagine Burger Up could be a decent place to drink for a bit after eating.  

If I attended Vanderbilt, I would probably go here on a moderately frequent basis.  If you want a change from the dive bar hamburger, Burger Up is a decent change of pace."
156,Great spot to come to if your in Nashville. The have one the best drink deals you can find on thursdays and Saturday's and Sunday's. Food is okay.
157,"Got there mid-morning today, the early rush was over. Two tables were full, each with three people. The family in one of the tables had just walked in ahead of me, so they were being attended to first. Still, I was immediately welcomed, and in a couple of minutes a friendly lady brought the breakfast menu and asked if I wanted coffee. A cup appeared a few moments later, and was kept full throughout my visit. Radio playing golden oldies from the 70s, my kind of music. The ham omelet with home fries and toast arrive a few minutes later, worth waiting for. Done just right and kept me filled for hours. A friendly family restaurant where you feel welcome and appreciated, just north of Gulfport."
158,"we had a groupon and so we went - great lobsters (although they were out of a few sizes this evening) but they were delicious and our waitress Jessica was very attending and nice - made some good suggestions.

not fancy but good lobster."
159,"Great little upscale but not overpriced cafe. Lots of options, but needs a lox bagel sandwich. :) One of my preferred places to lunch with someone."
160,"Arrive between 7am-9am on a weekday and get their breakfast bargain! Two eggs, home fries or LATKE, toast or biscuit, and bottomless coffee all for FOUR DOLLARS!

The service was amazing and I got a delicious breakfast and experience for less than it costs to take the bus to and from work."
161,Always crowded but how can you blame them? Last time I went in here I met 2 famous people at the bar and had the best sushi of my life! oh yea and waited 2 hours....
162,"I love their eggs! Their eggs taste better than any other restaurant eggs I've ever had. We always get the hash. Dawn Patrol is always super generous with the food portioning...with the hash, that is. My brother got a burger to go, and all it was was a piece of meat between two buns. However, he said the burger was really good, but still, I feel that they could've melted some cheese on top of the patty. All of their pastries, bread and jellies are homemade - and really delicious!"
163,"Came late Friday night for a bite to eat. Much of the soup, hot takeaway were cleaned up. Settled for an individual pizza to share. Crust was too thick, but we could debate pies until the cows come home. Wandered the store while it was baking and found Scharffenberger chocolate! Pie may not be up to our standard but the chocolate hit the spot. At 8pm at night, the staff was exhausted"
164,"Nice, old school space with a long bar. It reminded me of some places I've been out west, which might be a little strange in the heart of Philadelphia. 

Not too loud at all - conversations were easy and a lot of the patrons were doing just that. There's a jukebox, so maybe it cranks up later in the evening. We were there pretty early. 

Great service from several people working behind the bar. 

Several beers on tap including a local CCCCC IPA, which was solid. Not many wines, though.

Small menu but very good food. The elote (corn) is quite good, as was the cucumber(?) salad. But the brat plate was the star. Wonderful brat, German potato salad, sauerkraut, pretzel and a hot salsa/relish. Best brat plate ever. Served on a cool wood board.

Prohibition is located in or near a somewhat dicey neighborhood, at least to this non-resident's eye. I may very well be wrong about that. We had to walk a trashy, pissy street past what seemed like skid row coming from the hotel on Race St. If it was later at night we might have chosen not to walk back."
165,"I've only been once, but I'm ready to return.

Since moving to Fletcher Place, I've been looking for a bar near by that's similar to my neighborhood favorite, J Clydes. I think I've found it.

The Dugout is a simple hole-in-the-wall place. They have a decent selection, Sun King for $4.50, happy hour appetizers, and my favorite part: HOT PEPPER CHEESE BALLS! No longer must I wait until my coveted Mug N' Bun trips for these fried morsels of tasty peppery goodness. Had a nice little piece form this joint, too. 

Really excited to return."
166,"Went here last Thursday and arrived early enough to take advantage of their $5 domestic pitchers during hh which includes mich golden light, my fave! It did take the server about 10-15 minutes to even notice we were there, but after that service was just fine. 

Started off with the wings which were delicious, although the bf was certain it was not actually a pound of wings which they claim on their menu.

I ordered the gyro and fries which were surprisingly really good! Gyro meat was tasty and the fries were awesome! Bf had the French onion soup and potato skins which he said were good as well.

We stayed for rock n roll bingo (which I guess is every Thursday, and free!) and we had a blast. They also have a pool table and darts in the back which we played while waiting for bingo to start.

We will definitely be back!"
167,"Mr. X has amazing flavor and overall a pretty friendly staff. The wait time for carry out is on average about 20 minutes, which is way better than a 45 minute wait at chain pizzerias. I get the hand-tossed crust comparable to traditional NY style pizza, and has excellent flavor and texture!"
168,"As a double date with a good long lost friend for a relaxing evening dinner, we were surprised in early august to not get reservations until 8. 
So we arrived an hour early and had drinks in the lobby while the piano man played beautifully. The bartender was a bit slow at first but kept us well tended. 
Our table in the corner against the glass was ready early and we enjoyed watching the rays chase fish around the bay as the sun set.  
I started with the tasty crab and corn chowder but was a bit disappointed with al dente potatoes in the bowl. 
Wife ordered the scallops which were superb as was my crab stuffed grouper. But my rice was also inadequately cooked. 
Creve brûlée was excellent as was Tim's attentive service. 
Worth going again, but they need to get all the parts of the dishes correct to get 5 stars."
169,"This place is the epitome of a great hole in the wall find.  From  the  70s vintage floral upholstery  to the back entrance off the alley, it undersells it self and sets you up for a great surprise.  The food is good -- not fancy, not at all pretentious - but good. 

A group from work made the trek on the coldest day of the year and we were rewarded for our efforts -- the chicken hot pot was the best example this dish I have ever had.  The seafood dish with shrimp, scallops and squid was very generous for the price of about $10. The beef in black bean sauce was nice and spicy.  

I will certainly return, but only with adventurous companions."
170,Quack & Cheese is where it is at! We were there for the lunch menu. The duck fries are so delicious. It was my first time there & I ordered the portabello burger. They didn't have the right mushrooms & asked if a substitute was ok. I said sure. But I couldn't eat it. I asked for some kind of sauce & instead they let me order something else. That was so nice. I don't usually complain about anything. I felt like they really catered to our whole party. I would definitely love to come back for a date night.
171,"Awesome place. Great beer selection, music and friendly service. Check it out!"
172,"The atmosphere was nice and small. Very busy for brunch, expect at least a 30-45 minute wait. I recommend the spinach, caramelized onion and goat cheese omelet, but request a little less goat cheese. (this one was way too much, would have been better with 1/2 the amount).  Oh and the fruit was served perfectly ripe. Cash only."
173,Their mojo chicken sandwich is the best! It's an intimate restaurant with a hint of carribean and spanish flair. It has a laid back atmosphere and great service. The food is affordable and the staff are super friendly.
174,"Ask for Phil...I have read some reviews that have called him a bit of a Chatty Kathy and it's true. However, the service he provides is stellar. His reccomendations are good...I enjoy the octopusm but last time it was a bit overdone. You can eat here cheaply if you want just a little something. I tend to spend about a hundred bucks for 2 people, but have a bottle of wine and desert, not to mention numerous tapas. Try it, you'll like it.

I gave 4 stars because it has no private space for parties. That is a big negative"
175,We went a few months ago and had an appetizer platter which had cheese and honey. It was very good. Prices are somewhat reasonable and the atmosphere is good
176,"Really enjoyed the meal here. I had the General Tsao chicken and it was delicious. My wife loved her Curry Chicken as well. The portions were reasonable as was the price. The customer service was all very good. We ate there and they brought the food to our table. There is not a lot of seating, but there is some for eating in. I am sure that we will be back again."
177,"This place is a very nice sit down or take out place. I tried the famous hot dog and it was delicious, the beans gave it just the right texture. I also had the Tortta de pollo. It was very good. And my sister got the veggie tacos and they were also delicious. The customer service was great, friendly and accommodating. I will be back"
178,Sweet potato pancakes are a must! Very fluffy and delicious syrup. Staff was quick and friendly
179,"Sorry they've closed the restaurant as of 2/18/18. I always loved their dumplings, Peking duck, and other specialties."
180,"Was passing by this evening and decided to stop to place a to-do order. Walked in 15 minutes to closing time and the girl that places the order was busy cleaning. She immediately stopped, ran up with a smile, and took my order. Within 10 minutes the food was boxes up, and I was out the door. I couldn't be more pleased with the service. 
As are as the food goes, everything was outstanding! Even though I had to drive home to eat first, my food was still hot. I got The Original Grilled Cheese Sandwich with a side of Tomato Basil Soup & Mac N Cheese. The sandwich was perfectly grilled, the bread was buttery, and the combination of cheeses were exceptional. The Tomato Soup is a must! It is creamy, and very filling. It pairs perfectly with the grilled cheese and I don't think I could skip out on it. The Mac N Cheese was good but I think it could have been cheesier than it was. The bacon on top was great though, and I could really taste the smokiness in it.
The price is good for the quality of food you are getting. I could only eat half of my meal, since it is all very rich and heavy. That just means, the leftovers will make a great lunch tomorrow as well!"
181,"I went the first Friday that they were open with my husband, my mom, and a friend. There were some high highs and a few lows. 

For the table, we started with 4 of the small plates for $16-- the hummus, the hot potatoes, the olives, and the pickles. The hummus was incredible and a really large portion. The hot potatoes had great flavor but were served in a tiny bowl-- each of us was able to only have one small bite. The olives were served warm and were quite tasty. The pickles were a-okay, but I probably would not reorder these. 

For our mains, my mom and I split the trout, my husband had the roast beef sandwich, and our friend had the burger. The trout, in my opinion, was overly charred and lacked seasoning. Also, it was a whole trout, which, to be fair, is stated on the menu, but I do wish that the server or waitress would have explained a better way to debone the fish or offer to do it for us. We ended up with a weird pile of fish after we butchered it. The highlight of the trout was the potato gnocchi salad served on the side. OMG it was INCREDIBLE. I would order the subpar trout again in order to get this gnocchi side. 

My husband did not like his roast beef sandwich. I think he was expecting more of a French Dip, and this was more of a cold cut sandwich. The tomato on it was mealy, and he found the onion jam to be a bit too sweet. After a few bites, he gave up and focused on his side of kale slaw, which was very tasty. (The manager did take this off the bill).

The friend had rave reviews on his burger and fries so those are a big thumbs up. 

The manager came around to check on our meal, and we gave him his honest feedback. He seemed appreciative and brought out two desserts-- the brown sugar panna cotta and the peanut butter banana whoopie pies-- on the house. These desserts were definitely highlights so I would recommend saving room for the sweets at the end.

Service overall was fine for the first week. Some low points were that my drink (the Outsider) took 45 minutes to get to me and tasted strongly of lemon. Our waitress also took away our apps before they were finished-- this is a huge pet peeve of mine, especially because the olives, pickles, and hummus could have been used to jazz up the flavor of the trout. 

Overall, I'll definitely be back and look forward to them working out their opening week kinks."
182,"We ate here several times mainly because of the excellent Shrimp Ju-Ju appetizer.  In fact, our second night we had 2 orders of the shrimp.  We are grateful to our server, Colin, for recommending them our first night.   As I'm writing this review, I can still picture the shrimp and even better, I can still taste it.    There are a few dishes I dream about and this is one of them.      We also tried the fried calamari; it was good.    I'm from the north where we like marinara sauce with calamari.   In the south it seems to be served with sweeter soy or  sweet chili based sauces which I'm still getting used to.    Our entrees were very good: po-boy and fish of the day.     It's a nice place ambiance wise in a very good location.      I will give a shout-out to Colin for recommending the Shrimp Ju-Ju."
183,"We stayed at the Sheraton and they recommend this place. It was really great. I had the sampler and it was amazing, especially the crawfish ettouffe ! My husband had the shrimp and grits and he loved it. The staff was very friendly, I will definitely come again."
184,"I'm always amazed when sour-pusses write bad reviews of wonderful restaurants. 

If you like delicious food and really, really nice people, you will LOVE this place. 

If you are grumpy and always find a reason to hate everything, you'll probably feel the same about this place as you do about the rest of your life."
185,Pretty good place it only gets 4 stars because I like the one in carrollwood better that is the best one. But living over in south Tampa now I don't go to carrollwood anymore so this place will do. I like brick oven pizza and they make a better brick oven than grammandis .
186,"Had a vegan chicken burger and it was delicious! Tasty with good spices. Small space inside and a bit crowded when you are waiting for the food. But no long wait, exceptionally fast and this was during lunchtime. Perfect if you order food to go."
187,"You can't go wrong with the brunch at Luke!  I always get the fried chicken and waffles.  It comes with cane syrup and gravy on the side.  Ummm!  On a weekday, it is good for lunch or dinner with friends or the hubby.  I recommend the Luke burger (even though I believe it is sacrilegious to order a burger at an establishment such as this, however this is THE exception!) The flamenkutche is really good, too.  It is like a German pizza.  I also enjoy the cochondelait poboy, shrimp & grits, and croque madame , which are excellent.  We are never disappointed and always enjoy the ambiance of the old style New Orleans  restaurant."
188,"Tried the pizza this evening and was impressed, good sauce, toppings and nice crust. Good choice for pizza in Chalfont area, will definitely be back."
189,"Our first time trying on this rainy Sunday! We ordered a whole order of the House Special Fried Rice w/ beef added, A order of chicken wings, a egg roll, & a spring roll! The rice was delish!!!! The only thing was the egg roll was not what I prefer. The spring roll was the best out of the two! Definitely going back soon!!!"
190,"Swung by here while I was in town and was so happy I did. Great atmosphere, great staff and delicious food. The warm tortilla chips and salsa were quite tasty. I recommend the fish tacos."
191,A friend suggested this cafe for a lunch date a while back and I cannot stay away. My husband is obsessed with their Peanut Butter Deluxe smoothie. And while Its an obsession I cannot afford to indulge - their bread is what dreams are made of. I love to get their soup due jour over brown rice. Yum! Whether its Breakfast or Lunch - you can't go wrong at Cafe Deluxe.
192,"We had an amazing meal and experience! 

The service is wonderful - attentive and knowledgable and the ingredients and the preparation. 

Every bite was delicious as is the $55 price for the 4 course tasting menu. The gruyere popover was hot and savory and the perfect popover. I could eat a large bowl of the foie gras soup with the flavors of thai chilies and lemon grass. Both pastas were divine - the rigatoni with carrot top pesto with rabbit (prob the best dish of the night) and the saffron bucatini with blue crab with a little spice from fresno chillies. We had the fried game hen and the tile fish for mains. The tile fish was fine but couldn't compete with the flavor explosion of the game hen although the shrimp dumplings were tasty - wish there were more.  Desserts were a luscious semifreddo and carrot cake.

Drinks were well made but overpriced compared to the price point of the tasting menu (obvi to make some $$$).

Can't wait to go back. Wish we had more $55 tasting menus in NYC."
193,"Beautiful atmosphere with locally sourced kitchen made everything . Located right in the middle of 12th south and the popular angel wings mural - great place for brunch/lunch if you're in the area. Fries were nice and crispy while the lavender hibiscus tea was gentle and refreshing . This time I ordered safe but I can't wait to come back and try something new, maybe for dinner as our waiter suggested."
194,"I enjoy this place a lot. Went here on a Saturday night with a party of 3 and we were seated right away. They didn't have poori on the menu but the server said she could see if the kitchen would make it for us if we wanted. My whole group was happy with our food and there was plenty left over to take home. After negative experiences at other Indian restaurants, I will keep coming back here to get my fix of yummy paneer."
195,"Food= Amazing
Service= Great
Prices= Reasonable

Stop reading and start eating!"
196,Best breakfast in West!!!! The chicken & waffles never disappoint and neither does the service. I only wish they were open  at 2am so I can get pancakes after dancing at Dahlak.
197,"Quiet, good service, good fish, standard (boring and tasteless) app and salad, nice decor, good menu. Would go back. Would avoid the salad. Happy hour M-Th 5-7 drinks and appetizers."
198,"A friend & I went here when Spice Nation was unexpectedly closed on a Tuesday a few weeks ago. He had been before and gotten the pork belly bánh mì but this was my first time.

We split an order of the fried egg rolls + each got a bánh mì. The soups looked tempting but the bowls were so big! He got another pork belly bánh mì and I got the grilled pork. Since the sandwiches were cut in half we shared those too so each of us could have both flavors. We liked them both but agreed the grilled pork, which does have a brown sauce of some sort, was better.

Afterward I wanted something sweet so I ordered a strawberry smoothie to go. I asked for *some* bubbles because i wanted to try them but didn't want my drink full of them. Overall it was good but SUCH a sugar bomb.

The guy running the place was very nice, too. I asked him to explain what the condiments were on the table because they were labeled in Vietnamese, and of course he did. We didn't use fish sauce or hot sauce or vinegar but it's nice to know they're available."
199,"I am a novice when it comes to Korean food, but wanted to try something new. My son and I stopped in after the gym, we were greeted and seated immediately, offered drinks then left to choose from the menu. We ordered fried dumplings and two soup dishes. When the dumplings arrived they were accompanied by an array of side plates which were all  good ,the dumplings were not what I expected but deep fried and delicious. Now to the soup,I ordered chicken with noodles and vegetables my son ordered a spicy beef and vegetables soup. Mine came in the largest bowl I have ever seen the noodles tasted freshly made the dish was excellent. We both enjoyed our meals and wouldn't hesitate to come back. Two dishes and dumplings 36 bucks not bad"
200,"Salads are delish, although a bit pricey at $7.75 a pop. I felt the healthful salad eating justified a cookie though, and damn was that money well spent. They do baked goods and coffeehouse drinks, as well as bread-y and salad-y treats very well. 
Great lunch spot, eat outside on a sunny day!"
201,"There's lots of contention about the Euro-snooty attitude of La Colombe's baristas.  They may have a point.  However, since I lived in Philly and now in DC, La Colombe's Niza roast has been about the only roast that takes me back to my childhood.

Whenever I come back to Philly to visit my BF, which is quite often, I end up buying a 5-lb bag of Niza roast, in beans, to use with my trusty Gaggia. I do my own grinding and the coffee is absolutely delicious.

Having said that, the baristas should attend the Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People, as well as read the old I'm OK You're OK trusty book.  Their attitude does need improvement fersure."
202,"Born and raised in south Jersey I consider myself both a diner connoisseur and diner snob. This one is great!  A lot of locals eat here and the waitresses have worked here for quite some time. 
Breakfast and lunch are really yummy.  Food comes out quickly and service is prompt.  Really good quality food for ""just a diner"" and they recently expanded for more space- hooray! 
Great value plan to spend about 10-14$ for a good size meal."
203,"Really liked the atmosphere sushi was great.  Service wasn't as attentful as we wanted on a slow day, but was alright.  Will go back again.  Anytime the sushi chef makes it look like art with small details of the knife and placement of ingredients you know it's good.  For that reason would go back!  Not a huge fan of habachi so that's not what I would go there for."
204,"Great happy hour. Perfectly shucked oysters. Seriously, not one grity sea booger and I've ate here countless times. I am huge liver pate enthusiast. Luke has the best I've ever had. I usually go for  oysters, pate, and a few drinks so I can't comment on the entrees. Service is wildly inconsistent. On one occasion it was truly terrible. The manager noticed without us complaining and comped several drinks and dessert."
205,"Went the other night for take out got an order of 12 wings and a buffalo chicken cheese steak both were very good no complaints at all.  Wings were tender and tasty and sandwich was spot on better then average quality chicken.  Also, picked up a soup to go last second for only $1.50 chicken escarole was a nice surprise and great price.  Need to check out the dinners and try it a few times to see if they can be consistent with food, but for now was very pleased.  Owner may want to pull back on all the Dallas Cowboys schwag all over the place may not sit well with customers that are Eagles fans and I have no doubt this would turn them off, but maybe he is going for a laugh who knows just would not chance it.  Good spot."
206,"We had a reservation and were seated immediately upon arrival. The menu consists of small plates, so really nice for sampling a number of different items on the menu. We tried the sliders, fish tacos, fries and mac&cheese, all of which were pretty good. There was a lovely duo playing during our dinner and it was nice that we were able to enjoy the music and still have a conversation. 
A few tips if you have never been here before:
- Make sure you have a reservation or be subject to dine/stand at the bar.
- Even with a reservation, you are instructed to complete your dining within 90 minutes of being seated. Understandable. 
- Try everything!"
207,"Food is quite tasty, I was skeptical because it's a chaotic mess in there with some sort of assembly line to get your food, however much of it gets pieced together at the register."
208,"I have been wanting to go to a sushi conveyor belt place for the longest time!
So when I finally got the chance to go to Yo Sushi I was so excited! It's located at Int'l Mall on the ground floor, in the middle of the mall by the escalators and Godiva. 

I went during lunch time with 3 people on a Tuesday around 1 pm and was promptly seated. 
I ordered about 6 plates, 4 from the conveyor and 2 from my waiter. 
The sushi was pretty good, portions are small for the price but still okay. 
I got this eggplant dish from the belt and it was so good! I love eggplant :)

The prices are determined by the color of the plates. The price came out to about $25 for everything, which wasn't bad considering getting 6 plates. The salmon sushi plates were my favorite, and the popcorn shrimp was so good. 

Only problem we had was one of the dishes my friend ordered (Tuna Tataki) took like 30 minutes to get to us. I don't know if they put it on the belt accidentally or what, but our waiter didn't seem too concerned about my friend waiting so long for what he ordered. 

Hopefully service is a bit better next time I go."
209,"I am originally from Hong Kong and really enjoy spicy food.  This is one of the most authentic Szechuan Restaurant in the area.  In fact, it's really the only Chinese restraunt in the area that gets filled up with the majority of Chinese patron's on any given night.  Bottom line is Chinese people go where the food is good, so hopefully this place will continue to serve good food to keep us coming.  Szechuan food is spicy, so beware.  Each time we go, we order the Happy Fish in Spicy Soup.  The soft shell crab is another one we've tried.  The tea duck is great.  Anyone can definitely gravitate to the typical americanized Chinese food, but ask the server for the authentic Szechuan style.  I'm giving this place 1 less star becaue we've experienced a mix of servers where some are more patient and courteous than others.

On the final note, we've frequented this restaurant about once a month, but we've never had the problems with flies like some of the other reviewers."
210,"Every one raves about the oysters for Happy Hour, but check out the Daily Lunch specials.     You get a choice of app or soup and a fixed daily entrée.   Always a good bite at lunch time and you don't always need a reservation."
211,Excellent Meal - I had the pork chop and I think may have been best I have ever had. Delicious mustard sauce and cabbage. Very nice old fashions as well.  Another to add to the STL list of eateries on my travels here!  Do not miss this dish
212,"The Block in Webster is always a solid option for a good meal. They have a great happy hour, which keeps me coming back. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal here, but the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is that it used to be better. The menu used to have more small plates/appetizers and the deserts haven't been as good lately as they used to. However, we always get good service and enjoy ourselves."
213,"I'd heard the hype. Seen the NY Times article. Nevertheless I was skeptical. Mainly because most people have at best, two reference points for donuts, Dunkin Donuts or Krispy Kreme. Neither of which really makes truly great donuts.  So after waiting for the crowds to die down a little, I traveled over to see for myself last Saturday.

It's a small shop that blends into the surrounding neighborhood. Inside there are a couple of seats at the counter and a wide window well that two people could sit in. I ordered my donuts. I went with the Indian Cinnamon, the caramel banana, the pina colada, and the halva pistachio. The ladies behind the counter worked as fast as they could given the decent sized collection of people waiting for orders and bopping in. My order was processed quickly, and I got my coffee right after I ordered it. The coffee was one of the only things that was a disappointment besides the lack of seating.

 Since there was no room to sit, much less stand I took my donuts and coffee out to a park just off of Federal between 3rd and 4th St.
The donuts were truly transcendant.  Each donut was a symphony of flavors on my tongue.

The Indian Cinnamon-Very light on the cinnamon, coated with sugar. Hot, fresh, and so moist that it pinched in half when I started to eat it.

The caramel banana-A delicious meld of flavors with something added to the banana chips that made them more tasty than I""d imagined.

The pina colada-The donut I though I'd enjoy the least. However it tasted like the Rach 3 and Beethoven's 9th all rolled up. A complex mix of flavors that together was truly amazing. And unlike the current generations, I don't use that term lightly.

The halva and pistachio-the final movement. More subtle flavors that nevertheless worked well. I'd never had halva before, but I liked it.

Believe the hype. Believe the NY Times article. Federal Donuts makes some of the best donuts I've had."
214,"Yes, I feel guilty after I finished eating but that is just for like 5 mins then I just remember how tasty and awesome the burger was. If you are into burgers with a twist I would recommend visiting this place. If you are going during lunch break make sure you pop by early the place is small and fills up quickly."
215,"Best Onion Rings in Santa Barbara/Goleta!!! Rare combination of friendly service, good burgers and reasonably priced (Charburger for $1.99 on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday)  The service and friendly staff always have me coming back!!"
216,Watermelon pickles were amazing and the wedge was done well with great ranch dressing and juicy plump partly sun dried tomatoes
217,"I love Village Whiskey, it's just a shame it's always so crowded. The bar snacks and their signature burger are delicious. I'm bummed they did away with the warm pretzels, but oh well. The whiskey selection is extensive and the bar tenders are very helpful and knowledgeable. But be warned: their whiskeys by the glass are definitely a bit overpriced."
218,"I was walking on Delaware Ave looking for an ATM and a cup of coffee and wandered into the ING Cafe. After tapping my account, I walked around a curving wall and stepped into a very open, lively and orange public space. I had an excellent cup of Peet's, free WiFi, but honestly, the people watching was so good, I got very little real work done. Great spot to crash and get a cup, excellent vibe. So nice, you will wonder if you are really allowed to just walk-in like that."
219,Amazing pizza. Also love ceci bean dip. Great outdoor patio.  Recommend going on Tuesdays for half off select pizzas.
220,A lovely spot for a nice dinner. We had delicious Pacific Northwest oysters that made me smile and the risotto was rich without being overly decadent. The service was very friendly and sweet. My only wish is for a more varied wine list.
221,I was in Indianapolis on business and walked to Joe's from my hotel to watch the Super Bowl (they have a wall - sized screen! )  The teriyaki wings were really good.  The drinks were generous and the bartender was friendly. The weekday specials look interesting. I'll definitely come back when I am in on this side of the city.
222,"I took my son here as a surprise yesterday because he is a big fan of lobster rolls. I had a Groupon coupon, and it was well worth the money. The lobster roll dint disappoint, though I'd like to try other menu items, as well. My son thoroughly enjoyed his lobster roll, too, so again, it was money well spent to see him pleased! The restaurant itself is a little short on space and ambiance. When we were there, they were slammed all at once, but the owner stepped in, apologized, got us seated, and took our order. He was humorous and kind, which took the edge off. I will visit again and this time, I'll try the steamed shrimp or crab legs... GIVE IT A TRY, ITZ WORTH IT!"
223,"The food was good. Price was Ok. We were instructed to sit on a table next to the window which I really liked. The waitress was not very smiley and kind but she managed well enough. 
Overall, Its recommend for a good coffee and brunch! :)"
224,"This is a great breakfast sandwich spot. Affordable prices and tasty bagels, my favorite is garlic. I wasn't blown away with the lunch options but I would recommend this place for breakfast to my friends and family. Their quality is WAY better than Dunkin Donuts sandwiches. However, the man and woman behind the counter are very rude and it's a shame becuase the owner seems like such a nice man. They have ignored customers standing in a long line to hold conversations and move extremely slow as if no one has anywhere to go. Don't bother calling an order ahead becuase chances are they won't answer the phone during breakfast hours."
225,"If you're looking for atmosphere, go somewhere else. If you're looking for giant saucy chicken wings (for a good price) and great NY Style pie, this is the place. I was pretty surprised. I got a slice and 10 wings for $11 which I think is cheap. Try the teriyaki."
226,"I've been waiting for what seems like ages for Lee House's latest restaurant to open up shop. Seriously, it's been in limbo since the spring time. What took so long? I guess, as the saying goes, you have to wait for the good things in life.

Anyways, we had a little reunion with one of my buddies from out of town and went to check out Lee House's latest digs. The place was pretty packed for a Wednesday evening and is split into two different areas, the left side more compact with smaller tables while the right side is for bigger groups of families and friends. The restaurant has a very spacious, open air feeling and they clearly put a lot of time and effort into making things look great. I was hoping that they would put more of their focus on Korean BBQ, as Edmonton is seriously lacking a good place. We shall see, I'm sure things will change when they finish renovating their original Whyte Ave shop.

While we were waiting for my buddy to show up, we perused the menu which has quite the variety of options. We decided to try several of their BBQ options but sadly, we didn't even get to grill any meat. Sad face. Also, I have to mention service was pretty weak, even for an Asian restaurant. We could barely hear when the waitress told us what our dishes were, had to ask for tea several times, and it was hard to flag down someone to take our order. I'm sure it will get better once they settle in.

We ordered:
- Banchan and rice bowls - the banchan were all good, especially the bean sprouts and spinach. I just wish they brought out more/re-filled them during our meal.
- Bibimbap ($10.95) - steamed rice topped with vegetables (carrots, spinach, zucchini, daikon, bean sprouts) over a lightly fried egg.  They brought out the Korean chili paste in a separate bottle, so you can add as much as you want. The bibimbap was decent but nothing to write home about. 
- Jap chae bokeum ($11.95) - potato noodles with mixed vegetables, black fungus mushroom in a sweet soy mushroom sauce. This dish was perfectly done! Noodles had the perfect chew. I think I just love noodles. Someone teach me how to make this at home.
- Bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced beef marinated in a sweet soy garlic sesame sauce. 
- Spicy pork loin bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced pork loin marinated in a sweet onion, garlic chili paste. Slightly spicy, full of flavour, this was my favourite bulgogi dish of the night.
- Sweet ginger pork bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced pork loin marinated in a sweet ginger sesame soy. I didn't get too much ginger flavour from this one, but it was still quite tasty.

So to sum up, first visit (of what I'm sure will be many) was pretty good. Lots of interesting items to lure you back. We'll have to make sure next time we try out their other BBQ items and do some grilling! I'm impressed with all the good Korean restaurants in town - make sure to add this one to your list of must try."
227,"Absolutely amazing food! Everything is extremely fresh, homemade and majestic in the mouth. It's a bit pricey considering the portions and Ambiance but other than that... Amazing"
228,"The food was quite good, with the usual assortment of offerings.  We decided to take out -which this place is perfect for.  It is a bit hidden around the back of the shopping center, so it's not obvious to come across. However, this location (& plenty of parking) does make it a much more convenient local option for Indian takeout.  Plus, the prices are better than media too.  BYOB."
229,"* I noticed that this location is often reviewed as serving ""the best gyros in town"". Could be. I can't say, as it's the only place in town where I've purchased a gyro.
* I have a bit of a sour attitude toward beef and lamb mixed and grilled together. Every time I had it as a young man, it tasted... gamey. Smelled somewhat like moist dog food.
* It's been years of avoiding gyros, until tonight. I had some time to wait here in this area, so maybe it was time to revisit the gyro from a place that seems to know what they're doing.
* Yeah. This sauce was good enough to almost make me not notice what meat I was eating. It didn't taste bad at all. I don't think it's something I will make a regular meal, as I am sensitive to dairy/cheese."
230,"Great breakfast spot. Forget to check-in a lot, but have been coming here for months now. Recommend the biscuits instead of toast. They are delicious. Fruit cups change up what's in them but they are big and fresh. My favorite so far is runny eggs over corned beef hash. The scrapple is great, so are the breakfast potatoes.

Today  I had the grilled pastrami on rye with Swiss and 1,000 dressing. The only thing missing is some sauerkraut. It would be so much better.

The only breakfast dish I haven't been thrilled about is the sausage biscuit with gravy. The reason is because it's a sausage patty on an amazing biscuit. I wish they just put fresh ground sausage in the gravy instead.

Overall it's a great place, with just a few changes I think it could be amazing and a spot people would travel to."
231,"I frequent the HOB in Oldsmar about once/month, or so. I've drank there more than ate but have had the caesar salad for dinner before;it was pretty small but a great price. The buffalo chicken dip is DELISH as are the chicken nachos. The key is to go before 7pm for their happy hour, which includes half off their appetizers. They also have $5 beer night on Thursdays. You can bring up to a LITER mug of your own and they will fill it for $5. The place is small but the atmosphere was fun. HOB would be the neighboorhood bar if there were more things on this strip of street to do...we have a good time and it was a pretty chill atmosphere."
232,"Now this is a hometown diner. We went for breakfast and we will be back another time soon for lunch. 

A duster restaurant to burg bar & grill, this gem had a ton of breakfast and lunch options with some added Greek flare and a touch of Cuban dishes. To this native Floridian it's the fun options you'd expect to see at a local diner. 

I got the mama mias eggs Benedict which included spinach and mushrooms. I selected crispy hash browns as my side and it also came with a banana and strawberry. It was so good I wish there was less hollandaise since it was so good it didn't need that much. 

The guys got the Hungry Greek and an omelet and we were all happy. Choices between potatoes, hash browns and grits ensured there were options for everyone.  A banana and strawberry for everyone too.  

Portions were large, prices good and the choices abundant. 

We had Aly as our waitress and she was great! Friendly and awesome some recommendations. 

Check this place out for sure!"
233,Great spot! Also has breakfast until 3 vs many places which end at 11. The eggs Benedict and eggs Florentine were delicious. Strawberry mimosa was a bit sweet but good. Bloody mary is bomb! Server was very nice.
234,"Perfect place to take visitors. The plates are small and pricey but flavorful. Drinks are pretty much $10 across the board. The live music/atmosphere make the outing worth the cost. Make reservations if possible!
Fun Fact: My husband and I met Bill Murray and Jon Favreau here."
235,Very cool nostalgic-type bakery. You must try the pepperoni stromboli... NOW!
236,"Used Yelp to find a sushi place after a long day of shopping and it landed me at Tako. I have to say that the reviews lived up to the hype. The rolls here are well prepared, very tasty and everything seemed fresh. The private dining rooms are a nice touch, but they are also located next to dining booths so be prepared to look (possibly smell) people's nasty shoes as you need to take them off before entering the room. Definitely worth checking out if you live or are passing by the area."
237,Service was a bit slow but it was a Monday night and they had a groupon promotion so giving them the benefit of the doubt that they probably have more employees on staff during traditionally busy days but the gluten free pizza was better than any I've had within a 20 mike radius and I think I've tried them all. It was amazing. My husband who does not have a gluten sensitivity thought it was better than even their Sicilian crust (which he loves by the way). Glad it's in the neighborhood. We will definitely be going back.
238,"I've been visiting NOLA, and Back to the Garden was one of the places listed that is great for vegetarians. I really enjoyed my lunch here. Had the red bean chili with TVP, salad, and corn chips, and a cup of fruit salad.

I loved the chili, it was a bit bland, but very good. My friend put hot sauce all over hers. Salad, fruit and chips were fresh and good.

I loved the basic atmosphere, and enjoyed watching the folks working in the kitchen area assemble everyone's orders.

Good, basic vegetarian food. I really enjoyed it!"
239,"I've been wanting to try Stella Sera for about 2 years... and it definitely did not disappoint. Made a reservation for 2 on a Saturday night at 6:30pm. There were only 3 other tables there when we came in but it filled up throughout the hour & a half we were there. I would suggest making a reservation as there are only about 12 tables total - & it's BYO so bring your own wine. 

I forget the actual name of the appetizer we got but it was basically fried risotto with mozzarella & marinara. It came out as 3 decent sized fried balls. They were delicious. I got the filet - which I asked to be cooked medium... it came out more on the medium-well side but it was fine. It's an Italian place... I should have known better :) BUT, the sauce & jumbo lump crab meat & mushrooms on top of the filet was amazing. It was served with sliced potatoes & green beans. My bf got the gnocchi & it was served in a butternut squash sauce... so good. I almost wish I would have gotten the gnocchi because they were pillowy & delicious. I'd definitely come back for those alone. We also got a side of homemade pasta with marinara sauce. It was good but I've had better homemade pasta at some other places. 

I have to admit, I expected to be there awhile since all the food is made to order but we were in and out within an hour & a half. We'll definitely be back."
240,"Great cozy cafe for studying or meeting up with friends! Super well decorated and clean! Friendly staff! 
The food and drinks are really yummy but I find it is overpriced for what you get."
241,Had a Habebero Bowl.  It was tasty and a good portion for the price.Hubs has Tamales and he said they were very good. They have a nice salsa bar as well. Only real ding I give them is that their guacamole was not very good. It was almost like it might have had mayo in it....YIPES!!!Guacamole also had a lot if onion in it.  I am a purest when it comes to guacamole. Atmosphere was nice and clean. Seems Family ran establishment. I give them extra credit for that.
242,"Yes it a great place and great coffee. But none of these coffee places know how to serve a decent cup of black tea.
I should say start with the tea leaves but I'll leave that alone.
1. The cup of tea is scalding hot
2. The tea has a burnt taste 
So you need to lower the temperature 
Then get to back to other things like tea leaves."
243,"We had been here for Monday night football and liked the divey atmosphere.  We saw the sign the next day for 2 for 1 sammies, and knew the happy hour beer was great.  Much to our surprise it was bike night, 2for1 draft and 2 for 1 sammies!  Our bartender/cook was fantastic, no empty cups and the cooking show was fun.  The single server was keeping up with floor orders and helping refill the bar!  The food was fantastic.  We ordered the club, and the Titan cheesesteak, you can't go wrong.  The night before we got the regular cheesesteak, it came with cheese whiz, so good.  Definitely worth checking out."
244,"We went back for the same reason as in 2011 - we thought this was a different Italian Restaurant. Again, we were pleasantly surprised - the food and the service was great!"
245,"If you've never visited Eats, you are missing out. I judge ever place by their burgers and Eats does not disappoint. The V-Jack is a gut busting, juice dripping, artery clogging, tongue pleasing work of art. Two real beef patties, BBQ pork, cheese and BACON. It's just incredible.. The apps are super tasty as well.
We've always experienced superb service by a fun group of waitstaff. The kind of waitstaff that actually enjoy their jobs and make you feel extremely comfortable."
246,"I stayed at the Blake Hotel that is connected to this restaurant. Finally on our last day in New Orleans, we decided to check it out for breakfast. We had plans to hop on the streetcar right across the street and check out the Garden District. It wasn't very busy at the time so we were seated right away. Our waitress was extremely friendly and told us to check out the specials they were offering. We ordered Bloody Marys and Mimosas and they were delicious! I especially enjoyed the Bloody Mary. 

We ordered the fried green tomatoes eggs benedict and crab cake eggs benedict. They were both so delicious. The crab cakes were huge and full of delicious crab! The poached egg was perfect, I literally almost licked my plate clean. The home fries on the side were super amazing too, the seasoning on it was just enough and had the perfect crunch. My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his fried green tomatoes as well. I was able to get a quick bite and I can see why!  

What I loved most about this place is that we didn't have to wait over an hour to eat breakfast. Of course, there are a lot of great breakfast places in town but if you don't feel like waiting a long time, Cafe at The Square will not disappoint."
247,Loved the Mediterranean Grilled Cheese sandwich! Nice casual atmosphere. On the end of the strip so it is very convenient to get to during lunch hour. Looking forward to trying something else on the menu.
248,"All those cereal commercials are lying to you. A balanced breakfast doesn't consist of milk, OJ, cereal, and a banana. If you want a balanced breakfast, you should hop in line for fried chicken, a glazed donut, and coffee from FedNuts.  

I'm not much of a sweet breakfast person, but the donuts are great here. The chicken is wonderful, no matter how you have it dressed - wet or dry, they're all good. And when you're eating chicken and donuts for breakfast you're probably going to need something to get you moving afterwards; the coffee.

Oh, and don't try to convince someone to come with you that needs an explanation on why those two foods are served together. Those people don't deserve it."
249,"The food was excellent.  The service was ok.  The fried oyster salad was very good.  The seafood gumbo is silky smooth.  The atmosphere is a bit noisy, in the front dining room.  The bar looked very old and cool."
250,"If you're going to a show at the Union Transfer / Underground Arts / Electric Factory, then this bar is in a nice location for a couple of beers and food. I don't think I would make a trip across town to come and drink here, but I would definitely stop by again before a show.

Food: 
Menu is a small selection of typical bar food, but with what little they have, they do it well and tastefully. The brat plate was a nice, filling $15 deal if you want a little bit of everything. Fish & chips came out freshly fried and piping hot. Definitely several notches higher than your average bar food.

Drinks: 
Beer centric, but it's not like you can't get wine and cocktails...just noticeably limited.

Space: 
Cozy, so it can get crowded pretty easily -- not really a place to hang out all night."
251,Great pizza and fantastic wings. My only complaint is the bottle sodas come on get fountain drinks already and I would eat here more!
252,"The food here is good but I feel it's just a little over priced. For 2 adults and 2 kids, I spent a little over $40. For 3 burgers and a hot dog, I think it was a bit much."
253,"We went in early June with a group of 11 for an early dinner. The service was excellent. The server was able to guide us as to the best dishes that would fit our taste.

We had the grilled shrimp - very tasty with garlic and olive oil. 

The black paella was delicious - no fishy taste even though it used squid ink. The portion size she said we would get was not as large as she made it sound so if you are a crowd get two.

The battered and fried garlic was amazing - meltingly tender pieces of mellow garlic.

The pork belly was amazing - slightly crisp exterior and yet soft and supple with a rich flavor.

The beef tenderloin with port sauce (?) was very flavorful and best ordered in multiples it is so delicious.

The fried cauliflower was not greasy and had well developed brown notes. 

The Pudin con caramelo for dessert was terrific with a rich caramel sauce. Hot and crusty on the outer edges but a tad cool in the center. Have them cut it in half before they warm it so it is warm throughout.

The regular sangria was fruity and a good value ordered in a pitcher."
254,"My husband and I were wandering around Doylestown and looking for a place for a late lunch / snack. We found Hickory Kitchen and will definitely be back! 

He ordered a pulled pork sandwich with two sides - sweet potato casserole and beans. The sandwich was good, not exceptional but certainly nothing to complain about. The sweet potato casserole was about as expected, but the beans were as good as we've had in the area. 

I ordered wings and potato salad. The potato salad was good, but the wings were AMAZING!! These are my new favorite wings in the area. I ordered them with the house barbecue sauce, and while I'd like to try other things here, I don't know that I'll ever order anything else. When I want wings, these are exactly what I want."
255,"The pizza was good, though a little overpriced in my opinion. The atmosphere was nice and the location convenient. I would definitely go again."
256,"This is a sports bar that doesn't look like a sports bar from outside. Inside is a whole different story. There are TV's everywhere and a huge bar with plenty of adult beverage options. We came here for breakfast on a busy Sunday. We were a party of six and were immediately seated. We ordered, scallops, burgers, chicken wings, fish tacos, turkey sandwich, and salads. The wings were perfectly fried with tons of flavor, the scallops were tender & fresh, the sandwich full of lots of fresh shaved turkey, the fish tacos flavorful & fresh, and the salad was fresh, crisp with very good  ranch dressing. The service was speedy and friendly. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars was because the seats in the corner booth lacked cushion. It felt like I was sitting on plywood. Please, fix this soon. I will be back to this bar and highly recommend it when in Tucson."
257,"Yo- just order the Grits no matter what time of day you think it is. 

Historically, most of the time I was too hung over to recall how we got there, but thankful that I had arrived. Guaranteed that by the time I left I was a new person.

On a side note, Honey's always seemed to be part of the worlds longest walk of shame.  The only way to improve the place would be to offer a locker room with showering facilities.

One time, near Halloween, I want to see Pinback play at the TLA. I had dressed in a full Hooters uniform and received many accolades from my date, other concert attendees and the general public. The next morning we woke up and drove a scooter to Honeys. I sat there, a bit worse for wear, eating the Grits in that uniform and really could have used a shower."
258,"A cheaper alternative to St Elmos, Harry and Izzy's has a more casual, but classy vibe, with an esthetically pleasing dining room with a menu that suits a variety of tastes. I felt the service was less formal, but more genuine, and of course the prices more reasonable, and the menu more varied."
259,"Cool mom & pop Greek spot. Great breskfasts, greek salads, friendly, oersonsl service. Ssk for Jufy"
260,"I am a huge seafood fan, my husband not so much, but he loves me so he knew I had to get in one seafood fix while we were in SB. I found this place on yelp and it got the highest rating on the pier. I ordered the local rock crab special and it was great! Good soup, excellent fresh side salad with great ranch dressing and the crab plate was huge, plenty of crab for one person. They had great service, beautiful location (it literally sits out on the end of the pier with outdoor seating). The only reason I give this four stars is there was nothing on the menu that did not have seafood. My poor husband got the side salad and we had to go somewhere else to get him food. I guess that's what he gets for being picky."
261,Stopped in for lunch and had the special which was the LaPlaya and also had the Couchon which were both delicious in their own flavors.  The beef and shrimp were very fresh.  I was also able to try the con queso which was one of the best con quesos I have had in a while.  The chips were crunchy and hot.  The styling of the plate and presentation was unique.  Great waiters. Small venue but very nice.  I'll definitely be going back at some point for Happy Hour.
262,"This is an excellent restaurant, and an excellent addition to the neighborhood around Rittenhouse. We dined here last night, and were very happy. The ambiance and interior design are top notch. It's very impressive how the space has been transformed from the previous tenant. The food was outstanding, which is unsurprising considering the chef's pedigree. We had two lovely cocktails and a whole fish that was perfectly cooked along with a terrific short rib play on stroganoff. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is that those cocktails and two entrees ended up costing $140. The Love is really good, but it's also surprisingly expensive. Entrees are priced in the $30-$40 range and appetizers and pastas are not far behind. The Love bills itself as a neighborhood restaurant, and it would be, perhaps, the platonic ideal of that if the prices dropped by a third. As is, it's as expensive as any non-tasting menu restaurant in Philly. Is that worth it when you can eat for less up the block at Vernick, etc? I'm not totally sure. I'll definitely be back, and I hope the menu prices find an equilibrium with the awesome vibe and food--I'd love to make it a real regular haunt."
263,"The Lucky Perk is a pretty cool place to meet with friends or clients. I've been here a few times and always get good coffee and an inviting atmosphere. The only thing I didn't care for was the sausage burrito. It was hot but 99% potatoes and a 1% sausage. Not worth the money. Other than that, it's a cool place and I'll go back."
264,"Great breakfast for a great price, what more can you ask for!

Just came for a quick dine-in before shopping and must say their 5th St. Benedict was amazingly satisfying. It was the chorizo that was mixed in their gravy which made the perfect combination.
Oh and when you order a cup of coffee, its really a CUP of coffee. Lol
Place is small and didnt really have many pastries made the morning i was there. Must be an afternoon thing?

Ill be headed back for more of their menu asap.. whenever i fly out there again. :}"
265,"Would give it five stars except for one thing. First off, the food was great. Party of ten and everyone liked what they ordered. Our waitress provided quick and friendly service. She was great. Losing a star for the hostess. Told it would be 45-60 minutes for a booth to accommodate a party our size. Not a problem. Then I see three tables on the outdoor patio. I tell the hostess we would take those and they don't have to move them they are close enough that we would be good. She tells me she had to get with the manager. Holy crap you have to ask the manager ??  What, to accommodate customers and feed them in a restaurant ?  She came back and moved the tables together, which we didn't ask her to do. And man was she ever pissed about it. She didn't say anything but you could see it on her face."
266,Had the fried wontons with shrimp and ground chicken and a sweet chili sauce that was SO GOOD. I also had the beef pho that was also excellent. I was so pleased. The service was pretty good you seat yourself and they kind of leave you alone which I don't mind. My server kept my drink refilled and had a very pleasant attitude. I'm so glad I found this place and didn't have to spend $30 lol
267,"Truly, the Skyway Cafe is one of those perfect Brunch spots. The service is excellent, the coffee is brewed well and is refilled often, and the atmosphere is saturated with a regular, local crowd with a loyal following. Get in before 11 because it gets crowded!"
268,"I was looking for a gluten-free option, which basically left me with a taco salad. It was basic and not very filling, but good. I'd like to try the green smoothie- it looks delicious. I applaud this place for it's location and well designed menu. I hope that they can one day expand their venue to include seating and more gluten-free options."
269,"Went for brunch and arrived around 11am. It was crowded already but we were seated at the counter immediately. We started with the Bottomless Drip coffee and Apple Fritter donuts. Loved the donuts and the coffee's flavor was solid, but it could have been hotter. Although, on the plus side, I didn't have to wait for it to cool down before I could drink it. Our desert was followed by the cheesy blue corn grits with all the extras (I.e. a soft poached egg, scallions and bacon bits). I'm late to the grits game but I loved them. My lovely wife had the bialy (think bagel) and lox, and miso soup. She is more of a foodie than me and a chef to boot. She was quite pleased. Service was average to good. It was cool sitting at the  counter. We got to watch the chefs in action. There was a taller female that was very focused and professional, more than most. When she wasn't cooking she was prepping and/or cleaning. Not sure why this wasn't a five star rating, probably the average service. In the end we had a great dining experience. It was pricey but you pay for what you get."
270,"Good food but they need to work on their organization. It's busy, we know but the whole mobile order thing, people waiting and ordering food, refills, other customers that just need general assistance etc. It gets chaotic. For instance mobile ordering, I come and pick up my food. Once I click that ""I'm here"" button, my name should be called and my food should handed to me. However if no one ever acknowledges I'm there or if I can't get someone's attention because they just walk right past you, I'm left standing there unsatisfied."
271,"I'm not one to watch the chef shows so celebrity chefs don't do me. That said, the food was creative and cutting edge. We had the  four course tasting menu. The dishes have many flavors that reveal themselves to you one at a time which is fun. Small portions, but enough food. I had a wonderful glass of Argentinian wine which was fun. My only disappointment is that they only change the four course menu seasonally so no real incentive to go back again until next season unless I ante up for the six course menu which is just a little too pricey with a kid in college.  Wonderful service. Really top notch which is becoming more and more rare these days."
272,"The food was fantastic, the staff for happy hour and table service were above and beyond wonderful. We had the local yogurt and house granola plate, shrimp n grits (an egg accidentally jumped onto the floor and they were so kind to whip up another quickly), oysters all ways. 

However, and a big however is the take-out experience. We opted to run downstairs from the hotel, cause the menu was bigger than room service. We ordered two soups, two salads, a dessert.....we got two salads, one soup, no utensils. When I called back, the lady seemed a bit skeptical. Really! So we ran back down for the missing items and alas still no utensils, soooo we ran back down again. Bothersome, unapologetic, and ended our eating there."
273,"Really solid place. Pretty good value, but not quite as good a value as Ting Wong, M Kee, Nan Zhou. 

Salt and pepper chicken wings- Very good, not quite as fried/crispy as other places' salt baked wings, but still good.

Scallion pancake- Very good. Fluffier than most places I usually have it. They serve it with a sweeter sauce. I think it tastes better with soy based sauces.

Taiwanese beef noodle soup- Delicious. Very flavorful broth. Noodles are really good. My only complaint is that they should cut up the beef into smaller pieces. The beef portion in the soup is generous, but I'm trying to eat soup, not a steak.

Beef chow fun- Pretty good, a little glutinous for my taste. I like the noodles a bit wetter in sauce. Beef portion is solid.

Service is fine and friendly. Their English isn't great, but it's fine. I did have to explain several times that I wanted the rest of my food wrapped up to go. This was a bit icky, but when they put my leftovers in, they included my chicken wing bones. I shouldn't have to specify that I dont want chewed chicken bones to go."
274,"$12 all you can eat sushi on Tuesdays. The sushi was great, but the server was grumpy and slow. Order your next roll when you get served your first."
275,This place is a treat. I found this place on yelp during my trip to the beloved Nola. It was a last stop on Christmas Eve. It was very elegant and exquisite. The wine was good in quality and flavor. The food was very fresh and delectable. I tried the pate and it was a culinary experience. That ended up being my main meal since my sweetheart did not want any. I also tried the bread pudding which was amazing. The ice cream was made fresh. The drizzling and pecans  where the best part. I can't wait to go back and try more offerings.
276,"Wish I could've made it back in again. Great atmosphere, great bar with excellent happy hour prices and fifty cent oysters. A bit on the pricey side especially for just a lunch. I'd go back again when I return to this wonderful city."
277,"This place is delish.  The restaurant is clean and tranquil with food that is yummy and flavorful but not greasy.  The servers are genuinely very nice, although if it gets crowded they can be somewhat harried.  Still, it's a great staple in Santa Barbara that I try to hit every time I am up for the weekend.

Some fav dishes: Tom Yum Soup w/ lemongrass and chicken (all white meat that is cooked properly and tender).
Drunken Noodles with beef.
And any of the seafood dishes."
278,"Second time eating here, I had the classic cheeseburger with sweet potato fries.  Good burger, really good fries.  Service was good.  Atmosphere is upbeat, high-end casual.  Decent noise level for group conversation.  $12 for burger & fries is pricey for the size of this burger.  There are better places for a burger.  Huge selection of beers on tap makes this a great place to hang out and drink with friends though."
279,"Girlfriend (cpa) got their ""cpa"" and liked it. Me bring a huge GOT fan got the ""white walker"" both were good as were the pizzas!"
280,"Great Rock Crab, loved the clam chowder, excellent service. And who can say no to onion rings?

Didn't really like the fried seafood - batter didn't stay crisp very long. Nothing was over cooked, just didn't like the batter."
281,"My fiance and I ate here recently, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I had heard often enough that it was excellent, but I usually take others' high praise with a grain of salt. However, the Smiling Elephant definitely lived up to the hype. Both of our entrees were incredibly delicious - the best Thai food we've had in Nashville, by far. However, our appetizer (the spring rolls) were NOT very good, hence the four stars instead of five. Overall, though, I'd say a great place to go!"
282,Just what we were looking for.  A neighborhood bar with better than average bar food.  The meatloaf sandwich was delicious!  Sara was a wonderful bartender and gave honest suggestions.  Great find!
283,"Stopped here while staying at the nearby Omni Hotel downtown Nashville, and not wanting to eat at the hotel, we decided to give this place a try since it is within walking distance from our hotel. It was opened 4 months ago, according to our waitress. 
We had breakfast at this 24/7 diner. My husband had a quad combo of a huge moist pancake, perfectly done 4 strips of bacon, cook to order eggs (he chose egg white) and scrumptious potato fries. Loved it, and the portion was generous. 
I ordered the lox and bagel. This was just OK. It did not come with eggs or onion as expected. The smoked salmon was on the skimpy side for this order. 
I did like the endless strong coffee!"
284,Wonderful wonderful food and service! We had an outstanding lunch amid bonus that it was directly across the street from our hotel.  1 star off for service on the next day - I called that morning to order a to go to take with me for my long flight home.  I specified pick up time. When I got there they said the person who took the order forgot about it.  It wasn't ready and I couldn't wait as I had to leave for the airport. Disappointed when I had to have airport food instead.
285,"The food here is amazing and our server Geri is one of the best servers I have ever had. The char grilled oysters are a MUST. The reason I gave them 4 stars is because the manager was rude.  Initially we asked if we could move our table so we can see the parade and he responded saying ""really? Just for the parade?"" He had an attitude and made It seem as if our request was bothersome. Geri was great. Loved her."
286,"Every thing tasted great! The pie crust is perfect. The mac n cheese was very different and mashed potatoes were very creamy. The chicken tenders looked very juicy and the lemon pie was huge. Only three bad things Janas chicken had a few feathers on it, nothing except entres are priced and rolls are 95 cents, the bill for 3 was $47."
287,"Açaí bowl is big, topped with fruit and granola.  I bought several ginger shots which were in the cutest bottles, perfect for the beach.  I will definitely return to this location when I'm in the area again."
288,"I love famoso. They have a simple philosophy and it's no surprise their franchise has expanded so quickly. 

The pizzas are probably one of my favorites in the city, especially the brussel sprout/prosciutto chip one. It's amazing. 

I can never decide whether I like having to go up and order or not but really it never takes too much time and it's not hard to do! 

My favorite location is the one down in terwillegar - least favorite is probably jasper. Food is great everywhere but I like the atmosphere better in the newer ones. I've never been a high tables fan. 

All in all I have never been disappointed. And they take care of their customers. Service is always great. 

Sad the wine club had to go. :("
289,"dont let the entrance scare you, awesome place! Volcano and Sexy man!!!!!!!!"
290,"Really great service. 

And yes the onion soup is the best in Orlando."
291,"Atmosphere:  The craziness going on around you in Reading Terminal depends on the day and time of day that you go. It is really convenient that you can sit at the counter and get waited on there.

Service:  The staff was upbeat and pleasant.  They were the ones who recommended we sit at the counter, which was a really nice experience.  We didn't feel rushed to get out of our seats.  It was really great that they offer you a sample of the food if you are unsure.

Food:  Overall very good.  I was hoping for a bit more spice and strong flavors, but it seems like it is made marketable for the general population.  Which worked out fine with me because there were seasonings available on the counter to bump up the flavor profile.  I got the etouffee and bread pudding.  The etouffee was good, but the flavor got a little muddled after eating it for a while.  It didn't have the depth of flavor that I was hoping for.  The bread pudding was super delicious!  I would recommend it to anyone needing a sweet fix.  My friend enjoyed her jambalaya.

Overall:  I would certainly come back.  The convenient location, good service, and yummy food are all definite pluses.  I am not sure that it is the best New Orleans place in Philly, but I am happy to partake of the menu again sometime soon."
292,We order food for the office from here all the time.  The food is healthy but doesn't taste bad.  They offer a variety of foods from chicken salad salads to peanut butter and jelly in peta bread.  They also offer soups and smoothies.  They deliver right to our office floor.
293,"What a fantabulous date night with my favorite hometown chica at Il Giardino :-)  I was stoked about trying out this Italian restaurant for a while now because I had not yet been completely satisfied with my meal at any of the other Italian restaurants (chain or not) I've been to...and Il Giardino seemed like the hidden gem of Springhouse as it is tucked away in one of many shopping centers on that side of Bethlehem Pike.

Like Bacco, Il Giardino specializes in pizza (actually, I have yet to try Bacco's pizza, so stay tuned!), so it was time for the ultimate test:  how does its white pizza play out?  Was I setting myself up for utter disappointment, or was I going to be enlightened?  White pizza is not exactly the most complicated-looking pizza around, but I only know of one other place that makes a few versions of it spectacularly (Top Tomato in Philly!!!).  

As serendipity would have it,  I received two pizzas on this date night: one which I had ordered (prochuitto gourmet pizza) and the other that was free (Il Giardino white gourmet pizza) because the free one was apparently sent to my table by accident -- yay!!!  It was a wonderful surprise, because the pizza was fantastic.  The white pizza that eventually came out for me was also very delicious and is definitely in my top 3.  

The atmosphere, I must add, feels intimate not just because it was small (I would say that it's 1/10 the size of The Olive Garden) but because on this Thursday date night, there were people who were enjoying themselves around their respective dinner tables like families, even if they really weren't in the same family."
294,"Some foodie friends have been talking this place up to me so I finally decided to check it out, and it was definitely worth it.

The dumplings of the day were Pork and Mung Bean, and they were decent.  The dumpling dough is perfectly chewy and excellent as far as thickness.  The filling I thought was a little under seasoned, but when I rolled it around in the Chili Oil, it was quite tasty.

I also had the burger, which I thought was an unusual item to have on the menu for a noodle bar, but thought it would be interesting to try.  The burger is on more of a denser bread than a typical bun, and the mustard greens and acidic sauces worked great together.  The burger had a lot of Eastern flavors, but was still a burger, a well cooked one, at that.  Enjoyed a quick tasty lunch for 12 bucks.  As the temperatures rise this summer, I'll probably try the cold noodles and I think the ramen is calling for me this winter."
295,"Great service, great oysters.

All the doors/windows open air to Bourbon St. Nice place for lunch."
296,First visit for breakfast. Location is convenient in a small strip mall with Trader Joe's and Starbucks.  Place is clean and servers are friendly. I ordered bacon avocado omelet which came with toast and a side of potatoes. It was ok but I expected more for the price. I also had coffee and creams were prepackaged. I am used to real cream. Overall it was your average breakfast and prices were ok. I am giving 4 stars mainly for location and service.
297,My family ate here last night and thought the food and service were excellent.
298,"Can I first confess that while I'm a Top Chef fan, I'm mistakenly thought Kevin Gillespie was Kevin Sbraga? Imagine my surprise when I sat down to my New Year's Eve meal and I saw a brown bear instead of a ginger bear.

I've been excited to know a Top Chef winner has opened up a restaurant a few blocks down my place but I haven't gone for months because I felt somewhat intimidated. The price is of course a little higher and I've always had a distaste for restaurant that only offers taste and not fulfillment. So when it was a few days before X'mas and the few restaurant newsletter ever so ""gently"" reminded me that the New Year's Eve dinner is actually a big deal, I started soul searching for a restaurant that I always wanted to try but haven't had a chance to do so, my mind landed on Sbraga.

The place has the very same decor that the hipper restaurants in Philly and New York favors, walls lined with wood planks, the very urban wood cabin feel. Silver and black balloons filled up the ceiling for NYE, the place was packed with people. 

On New Year's Eve, they offered a 4-course champagne menu. While it is nice, it's 3-times more expensive with no selection whatsoever and I'm a light-weight drinker, and it was early and I like to choose, so we opted for the regular four-course menu.

I indulged in the rich and surprisingly sweet Foie Gras Soup. It's velvety, almost like a sabayon. For the second course, I had the Sea Bream which I recommend the dish wholeheartedly. The Sea Bream has a really crispy skin, the fish is well cooked. The same can be said about the piece of pork belly in the dish. I also love the squid ink sauce and the calamari ""noodles"". Love it. would eat it again, would even try to make it in my own kitchen. For the third course, I had the fettucine with the perfectly cooked 62 degrees egg. the egg is indeed perfectly cooked, but it's not much different from a pasta carbonara. Maybe even less, since the amount of pasta is little and the dish is recommended to be mixed up, the pasta to egg sauce ratio is a little out of whack. The whole dish is a little more ""decomposed"" than I like it to be. The churro/coffee creme brulee is a nice finish to the meal. 

I wish that the whole meal is more filling, but at the end it wasn't too bad. Me and my friend was debating whether we wanted a sandwich after the meal, but it was fine. Service was good, our server is charming even though he spilled some water. I had a Sbraga Punch which to me tasted very much like cough syrup and he had no problem switching it to the Bell Hop for me which was quite unique and pleasant. Being sat right next to the kitchen also has its perks, other than being right in Sbraga's face, occasionally you'll hear they yell ""Service!"" which it's almost like they're putting on a show for you before you hear it enough and you wonder whether they are having problems with their wait staff. The couple next to us were obviously not a Top Chef fan, since their waitress told them that she'll ""relay their compliments to Kevin"" and they were murmuring to themselves that they had no idea who Kevin was.

Will I go back? I would probably, if a friend hasn't been and suggest to go. Personally, I still like to have a meal that fills me up, especially if I have to pay almost $100 per person."
299,"Go here and get a burger.  Get the King Burger and the Village Whiskey Burger.  Also get some pickles and eat your face off.  I like going here and just stuffing my face and enjoying every minute of it.  From the duck fries to the deviled eggs - order, eat, and enjoy.  Just go and eat and savor.  Yeah your gonna pay but it is worth it."
300,"Very stylish joint that's great for a casual date or dinner with a group of friends. I've had a few of their entrees and, while their sides can be a little bland, they dominate their meat dishes (considering they're going for a ""hip butcher shop"" vibe that shouldn't be too surprising).  My personal favorite is their pulled pork. 

The outside patio is great for chilling in the evenings and having some local craft brews (a decent selection), but some areas of the patio have mosquito swarms so be wary of where you sit if you're planning on staying a while. Definitely would recommend."
301,"The food is solid messy BBQ-y hand-you-cups-to-test-all-our-sauces all American belly fill. Little expensive, trendy, not my usual favorite but they do a good job of it and you get exactly what you want out of ""let me have that savory chomp of meat."" Their fries are awesome. Their BBQ sauces are a little mustardy all-around, but they mesh well with different menu items and equalize. I love that there are vegetarian options but I doubt they attract many with it when the next door panini bar sounds like better fare for veggie fans. 

Hickory Kitchen lacks in space. They got slammed with throngs of screaming young families moments after we calmly sat down in a cozy sunny corner with our order placed. This meant our meal was - by us - rushed to make space. I don't know if it was standard for a Saturday, but they earn some big props for calling down the owner who ran in to bus tables and take over the register for his employees. 

Overall: possibly beware screaming young family crowd for lunch, be assured they call for reinforcements rather than let you suffer, and solid yumminess to expect - get the fries - and feel slightly food comatose the remainder of the day."
302,"My dad and I came to Philadelphia for a night from NYC to sight see. We got in around 5 and were pretty hungry, so we went to look for a place with good food that wasn't too touristy. We stumbled across this place and decided to give it a shot. We sat in the restaurant area since I'm underage, but I liked the atmosphere. Our waitress was really nice as well.
 My dad liked the beer and I liked the food. I got the pulled pork sandwich with collard greens. The portions were huge. I've never had barbeque made with vinegar sauce but I really liked it. For dessert, I ordered the Red Velvet Cupcake. Now, I'm from Southern California and I have tried red velvet before, but I couldn't understand what the fuss was about. I decided to give it another try since I was on the east coast. Best. Decision. Ever. I finally understood what Red Velvet is supposed to taste like. It was delicious! I felt like my sight had been restored and I could finally see what I had been missing out on. 
I was surprised to find such a great place so close to our hotel. I wish we could have stayed here longer so I could have tried more of the menu."
303,"Love the food and decor but this place is incredibly loud! The servers are great but the hostesses could use an attitude adjustment - not very friendly for the first people you talk to when you arrive. 
I love the pancakes and the bacon is always crispy. My mom loves all of the fresh soups and salads. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The online check in is nice too since the wait is always long on the weekends!"
304,"We tried Izumi last night after reading the great reviews from here. It was a great eating experience. The place was small but had a comfotable feel and the waiter was great. He explained everything in an upbeat fashion and his recommendations were stellar. 

We got various sushi dishes such as the Rainbow Roll, Passyunk Roll, Spicy Tuna and California Roll. Which was the best Sushi I had in the city to this point. We will be returning soon to try different offerings."
305,"I had the Entrecôte Grillée et Frites (picture included) and my wife had the Boudin Stuffed Porkchop. Both meals were amazing. In addition, we walked in on a Friday at 5pm with no reservation and were seated immediately. 

The only negative comment is the that the wait staff seemed stretched a little thin. We got our drink orders and it was probably 10-15mins before they came back to see if we were ready to order. I even noticed the couple next to us also trying to get the wait staffs attention so they could pay their bill.

Overall, it was a great experience and we plan to come back in the near future."
306,"Mellow mushroom has some great options for a different selection of pizzas. 

Most recently I ordered the Mighty Meaty - Mellow red sauce with mozzarella, pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, ham and applewood smoked bacon.

I crave for this Pizza anytime I am eating some other knock off meat pizza from dominos or pizza hut. The ingrdedients, the crust, just everything together makes this my go to pizza.

I will say the wait time does take a little longer than I would like But for what I'm getting, it's definitely worth it. 

The restaurant is a cute fever dream of large mushrooms and trippy colors. I definitely like to stay and eat so my pizza is fresh out the kitchen but taking it to go is fine as well, the pizza will hold. 

If you are from out of town or haven't been to a mellow mushroom, definitely stop by!"
307,"We tried it and the place looks pretty fancy we thought maybe out of our the budget but at the end it ended up nicely priced for seafood. Very tasty jumbo shrimps with grits. I would say that we were not lucky due to some noisy group around bit the service was good woth great food, definitely a nice place to gove a try for seafood from NOLA"
308,"I had a bad experience with a weird smelling fish dinner last time. So I do not recommend getting any fish dinners. 

Besides that, the ceviche is probably the best I have ever had! That is the whole reason I came back. Big chunks of fish! The hot is a little on the spicy side, so I will get the medium next time. The plate is big enough to split with a date. Then we split the anticuchos de carne. It came with chimichurri sauce. I would definitely order that again!"
309,"No complaints here. Mom and Pops style diner with good traditional breakfast. Restaurant was small so was worried it would be busy but was pretty dead when we walked in. The service was quick and the food came out hot and fast. I orderd the farmers omlet which had ham, bacon, sausage, and potatoes. It also came with a large portion hash browns that were just as good! I would definitely recommend this late night breakfast joint!"
310,"The food is good, especially if you are looking for delivery nearby. Their prices are a little high, though."
311,Great weekday buffet ! Mattar paneer was off the hook!
312,"The Nook is located in one of those centers one can drive by a million times and never really notice. It is on Vassar very close to the corner of Kietzke.

We had lunch today and found the place clean and pleasant along with very amiable service.

I had a regular Cheeseburger, Gus requested the breakfast chicken fried steak be made in to a lunch order and this is how it came out. My sister had a patty melt.

Gus really enjoyed his meal saying the gravy was quite tasty. My cheeseburger was cooked just as ordered and too was very tasty and sis was thrilled the patty melt came with American cheese as apposed to the usual Swiss and she enjoyed as well. /

Very nice meal at a reasonable cost, cool huh."
313,"I really loved Ralph's. We came here for a rehearsal dinner for a friend. The space is lovely. The balcony upstairs offers nice views of City Park. 

The staff was very good and friendly. We had a set meal. Started with some delicious gumbo. I had the red fish which was outstanding. Spicy and peppery with a not too heavy sauce. My friends found the potatoes a bit salty but I didn't notice. I also tried the shrimp dish which was excellent. We ended with a bread pudding that was a good sweet end to dinner. 

Really enjoyed Ralph's and would love to come back some time."
314,"Grabber a quick dinner to Kampai : I was pleased with their good quality sushis, I like that you get a soup and a salad included with your order. I wish it was a little bit less pricier and more choices for the hand roll (e.g regular salmon/avocado) Good service as well, I recommend."
315,"I really like it at this bar. I wish I lived closer because it is a great bar to hang out with friends or even for a simple date night.

The beer is good and there is always a lot on tap as well as in bottles. There food is surprisingly good too. The french fries are killer shoestring fries, their mac and cheese is pretty good, and the fried green beans are great!

I did not like the polenta fries, but the rest of the food made up for it.

I would recommend getting a bunch of apps and splitting them, which is what I've done with friends."
316,"Small Japanese sushi/hibachi restaurant that seems to always be busy, even on a Thursday night! We had a group of 7 and were lucky that we were able to be seated together without a reservation. The menu is extensive and has some definite traditional favorites, but also some variations and different dishes as well. The presentation on every dish is on point.

I had the coconut milk, fried calamari, and baked Philly roll. Lots of food at a good price and I left feeling stuffed. There's a lot of vegetarian options here, including tofu teriyaki and a pumpkin roll.  Between the 7 of us, we tried 5 of the desserts as well. Everything was delicious. They also offer a gluten-free soy sauce!"
317,"Cafe Napoli rt 40 . That was our spot great Great great food . Fresh garlic ,fresh basil. Great people. Must try serios pescatore, scallops scampi . You can see chef cooking ."
318,"I'm so confused!!!  The pictures of the burger look so amazing how can you not want to just eat your phone BUT the BBQ oysters at Red Fish Grill I know are amazing BUT the BBQ shrimp cooked in spices and herb butter at Deanies are so highly regarded.  SO where would you eat if it was your last lunch of a great NO trip?  Hard to choose, right?  Wrong!!  We went to all three and were not disappointed in the least.  I suggest you do the same.  
Start at Lukes and split the $16 dollar burger kinda pricey but very tasty.  Then Walk over to Red Fish Grill and eat  two orders of their BBQ Oysters (you'll feel cheated if you get just one order) with an Ice cold beer. Now realistically that should be enough for lunch but its only fish, not too filling? 
Now onto Deanies to sit at the bar and eat these amazing shrimp, however, I'm not sure what was better the shrimp or the loaf of French bread to dip into the butter with and washed down with an ice cold Heferweisen on tap!!! My God was it satisfying. I haven't felt that satisfied since my ""first time""!!! Screw the calories I'm in Nawleans! Now I think I know what a junkie must go thru when he needs his fix.  You can't just get these flavors anywhere you know. 
And if all of the above wasn't enough like too idiots we walked to Café du Mond for coffee and beignets. 
We took a cab back to the hotel because we obviously could not walk, had a quickie and took a nap so we could dine at GW FINS which was also a fantastic experience.  Try the Scallabutt (scallops fused with a hunk of Halibut).  Se bon!! and Happy eating!"
319,"Been here twice in the past 2 years and both times the food was excellent! Roast beef sandwich - A+. Fried oysters - A+. Grilled chipotle-bourbon Wings - A+. This is far more than typical bar food. Most recent visit was 11/26. After our meal we asked for a couple of Jaegers and the manager(?) suggested an alternative. I wish I could remember what it was called. It was delicious AND he gave it to us on the house! Great food,  great service, great location!!"
320,"Food was great, service was not. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt it was an anomaly but it wasn't  busy and no one was very friendly and my order was wrong. Having said that, the coffee was great and the hash was really good--fresh, tasty, and nice portion."
321,"The saddest thing about my experience with Burger Up's food was that I ordered it through a delivery service that will not be named. 

I ordered a pretty basic cheese burger, but it was absolutely delicious. I will stop there because the MONEY IS IN THE TRUFFLE FRIES.

Listen, I don't really understand who came up with the idea of the truffle fry, but my goodness  Burger Up has perfected this delicious side to the very last grain of truffle. The shoe string style is amazing and to top it off, the perfect house-made honey mustard is the perfect dipping sauce for anyone and I hate mustard. 

So, yes, get the fries and a side of a burger."
322,They do not skimp on their sandwiches here. Solid 5 inches in diameter with tons of bacon and cheese. Not especially clean but definitely tasty.
323,"We went to the Tyrone location after visiting the Sarasota location many times.The Tyrone location is beautifully decorated, the staff very friendly, and the food delicious. We went on a Friday night and the restaurant was very busy, but we got seated right away. Although the Sarasota location is closer to our home...we will be back to the Tyrone location. While the Sarasota location is perfectly good...the Tyrone location has a bit more going on."
324,"Nice sit-down pizza spot in the Loop area, near Washington University. We went on a Friday night, so they were fairly busy and sat outside. Service was friendly, but not as attentive as one might hope.

Pizza was very good...we had two types of pizza. Ingredients seemed fresh, and the crust was nice and chewy. It seems like a small would be enough for two....they recommended a large, but we only ate about half of it.

The inside seemed very loud...we were glad to be sitting outside.

Overall, a nice spot for pizza."
325,"My favorite Reno lunch spot and has been for years.  Love their sandwiches and salads.  Deserts amazing too.  Nice ambiance.  Owner a doll.  The ONLY thing I dislike, and don't understand, is how bad the service is!  Waitresses are always SO slow!  I typically have to go track one down to take order...annoying.  (Albeit they are  friendly)"
326,"Great luxury institution of Nashville. The wait can be long, but the atmosphere and vibe of the place is worth it. We got the potato pancakes and eggs, which were good as well as omelette. Apple sauce also came with it. Cooking here isn't fancy and reminds me of more of home cooking but great nonetheless."
327,"We enjoyed both a great breakfast and a great lunch here recently. Our servers were friendly, sweet and on their A-game. The very small kitchen has a little trouble keeping up with the demand of the closely-packed tables. Highest praise for the fried green tomatoes and the avocado bowl. The Caesar salad had freshly grilled chicken and thick shavings of parmesan. The oyster po boy was full of outstanding oysters and served on really good bread. There were a couple of disappointments: the coffee tasted as if it had been stewing too long and the pancakes weren't warm when they hit the table, but they were still tasty. Will definitely return."
328,"First off have to give the service and amazing rant. The waitress whom I believe was the owner was friendly, helpful and a pleasure. She asked how everything was if we needed refills in timely manners and was genuine. I got the goulash, spatzle and red cabbage. The food was very tasty seasoned well and presentation was down hone style but appealing to the eyes. I was full but took home a slice of black forrest chocolate cherry cake which was great. I would highly recommend the restaurant and I will be back."
329,"Excellent if pricey meal in a tiny room, a little too close to the neighbors, but a great BYOB none-the less. We enjoyed the Bloody Beet Steak, Tom Culton's Salsify, Pappardelle Duck Ragu, Wild Striped Bass and Old Spot Pig Sirloin and Jowl. Everything was super delicious, and very well presented, with perhaps the Winter Vegetable Salad a bit disappointing - more a matter of my choice than the dish itself."
330,"Vanilla bean lemonade was interesting, but I probably would not do that again. Cheese and cracker plate as an appetizer was very good.   Mac and cheese appetizer had some interesting flavors but seriously needed more moisture.  Lemon artichoke soup was cooked to the point it lost a lot of identity and tasted like a vegetable soup. Those that like a great lemon Greek style soup, this isn't it. Chunky avacado salad was light and excellent. My favorite thing I ate. Crab cake had good lump crab, but a bit too much breading. Chicken salad was good without being remarkable. The live jazz was a nice touch. Overall, pretty good.  Flavors were pretty deep and developed everywhere except in the soup. I'll try something here again."
331,I love this place! The pizza is perfection due in part to the wood fired oven. The appetizers are great too. They use really ingredients and it shows. It is a simple neopalatin style pizza but the flavors all work well to make a great pizza. Service is great and they always have a amazing selection of beers.
332,I love this place as it's one of the few with the French bistro feel in the lou. The beignets were hot and fresh but some raw dough in the middle. Don't inhale or you'll choke on the powdered sugar. If ordered a burger with bacon and egg as my dish and we also had lattes which were kind of light for my taste. Maybe too much milk. I enjoy the ambiance here and the fries. Get fries and mussels if you like mussels. Very nice server and accommodated our toddler with the kids proof cup. I'm big on this now. I want to eat out at nice places with my child so being offered a high chair automatically is a new rubric for me on service.
333,"This is nice little Chinese bakery in the heart of Philadelphia's Chinatown! The female cashier was very friendly (flirtatious!) and the pastries shown in nicely adorned display cases. I stopped by early one evening had a sesame ball, which was filled with bean paste. The glutinous rice of the ball was nicely flavored, similar to Bai Tang Gao. Definitely as place worth stopping at if you are in the area."
334,"Dont let the buildings past keep you away. The interior and food have undergone a complete remodel. The menu is a great version of modern American fare.
Service was pleasant as well as the flavors in the food. Be sure to order pepper jack cheese sticks with sriracha dipping sauce for a nice departure from the old mozzarella sticks.
We plan to return for dinner soon. You should plan to stop in and try a new Reno spot that's worth the gamble!"
335,Great food. The owner was so nice.  Lacks a bit on atmosphere but makes up for it with the food.  Will return for sure the next time I'm in the area.
336,"We found cyranos on yelp and since we were in the are looking for lunch we decided to give it a try.  

We ordered the spices bourbon Collins for a beginning cocktail-would highly suggest it. Kinda like a ginger cookie with a bourbon flare. 
For appetizer we got the ahi tuna-deeeelicious!
We then shared a Beet salad. Another party in the mouth. Next was the Cuban sandwich and we choose the slaw with it choosing to stay away from fattening fries. I would not chose the slaw again but I am sure that is just a taste preference. The sandwich however was amaziiiiiing.  

Service was good and we would definitely eat here again. I would like to try it for dinner next time."
337,"We loved the original and used to be regulars. Surprised to find it is still here, in a new location behind Publix.  So good. Great service and delish Beal Parma.  Serving local brews as well as craft."
338,"First time back to Nashville since I was in high school, and can't believe I haven't been back sooner! Here at Vanderbilt for a class, and kept passing by the Tavern on my way to campus each morning... Had an inticing, rustic, downtown Manhattan look to it. So I put it on my list of places to check out. I looked here in Yelp, and saw it had great reviews. 

I came in for dinner tonight, and immediately noticed the reclaimed wood door, wrought iron, and alternative rock playing. I knew it would be a great place. I sat at the bar, as I was here by myself, and immediately got a menu and was offered a drink. I had the 1920, which was a little stout, but better than weak, am I right? I ordered the lamb tacos, Tennessee tavern fries, and cinnamon roll bread pudding. Tacos were small, but honestly a decent portion considering how much meat was on them. They were hot out of the kitchen, and the roasted peanuts gave it great crunch. Now, the Tennessee tavern fries ... Sweet potato fries with a touch of cinnamon and sugar, with jalapeño ketchup. Shut the front door, these were to die for. Light and airy, arrived in a mini frying basket with abundant portions. The ketchup was amazing, and I definitely asked for more. The cinnamon roll bread  pudding was a muffin size portion, with vanilla ice cream, homemade whip, and caramel sauce. Great flavor, not overwhelming. 

Service was fantastic, and even met some fun people! Highly recommend this place. I'll be coming back for sure."
339,Pizza is made to order anyway you like it. Thin crust & very tasty. Line gets long at lunch but worth the wait.
340,"Great drinks, service was on time with complimentary ice cream on the house before we left. Bombay misbehavior is a MUST TRY drink."
341,"This restaurant has been holding a spot on my bookmark list for quite some time. We were pleasantly surprised to find a lunch buffet here on a recent Friday afternoon visit. 

The lighting and high ceilings are *different* but I can happily see past them for the chicken tikka, palak paneer and Chana masala. The buffet rice was on the dry side but for $7.99, I'm not complaining too much."
342,comfy place with good egg sandwiches and really amusing bathroom graffiti
343,"Ok sometimes the hype  doesnt meet what is delivered, but I think Fed Donuts needs more hype.  Finally had  the chicken after several of their amazing donuts and all I can is wow. I had the buttermilk ranch it was amazing. Unlike any fried chicken that I have prior. I will make it a weekly spot from now on. 

Get there early things tend to sell out before 2pm."
344,We love the craft cocktails and craft beers. The food is hit and miss. The batter on the fish and chips doesn't hold up. It's soggy and gross. The quality of the fish is good but a new batter recipe is mandatory. Their classic burger is good and so are the fries.
345,"The service can be slow sometimes but the food is worth it. The potion sizes are great. Three rolls, app and miso soup are filling for 4 to 5 people. They have some fun mixed drinks."
346,"Stopped in for takeout and got a half chicken and lomo saltado. The lomo saltado was delicious. My husband saved the white meat chicken for me (it's usually my favorite) and unfortunately, it was inedibly dry. Hubs said the dark meat was amazing though, so hopefully my white meat dryness was a fluke. I would definitely go back for both the chicken and lomo saltado."
347,"This was my first visit to 3 Sisters Cafe and I was not disappointed. I had just come out of a physical therapy appointment for my spouse down the road at Athletico and wanted a tasty, fast breakfast -- with FAST being the operative word here. 

I took a chance on 3 Sisters and it really paid off. We were in and out of there with great service in about 35 minutes total. It's a small place with friendly servers. I had a classic breakfast: 2 eggs, toast, and bacon. This was called ""The Don"" and came with potatoes but they swapped the taters for bacon at no additional cost. What an unexpected surprise! Everything was cooked to perfection: eggs over medium, wheat toast perfectly toasted, and crispy bacon. 

My husband ordered a ""half"" order of pancakes which was a single giant pancake that took up literally the entire platter. He also had a side order of eggs. The portions were so generous that he wasn't able to finish it all despite having just worked up an appetite from the physical therapy. 

The only thing I wish I could change is the acoustics in the place. I love that it's a converted old cottage house, but the echoes of nearby diners is pretty disruptive. There were only 4 groups of people counting us and it was pretty loud. We considered moving to their nice outdoor dining area but it's 85 and humid so we stayed put. 

I'll definitely be back with friends!"
348,Wife and I both got the strip. Very very good steak. Great seasoning.  The au gratin potatoes were a little rich but a great addition. Ask them to add grilled onions to your steak. excellent. If you are looking for a good steak try Stoney River.
349,"I love this place. It's awesome for takeout on a weekday, and it's nice to have a Thai place in North County. I love all the noodle stir fry's. I recommend the banana wontons served with honey- They are on the appetizer menu but are great for dessert! I also really enjoy the sweet potato appetizer. The restaurant definitely lacks any ambience, but it has some really great food and is worth stopping by on a regular basis."
350,Great seafood. Had 1/2 shrimp and 1/2 oysters. The meal arrived at the table hot from the fryer.  Seafood was FRESH. Some of the best fried oysters I have had in a very long time beside Mike Andersons in Baton Rouge. I'll. E back when in Kenner again.
351,"If you're ever in the mood for an affordable and tasty Po'Boy in the Gentilly area, make sure you stop at Zimmers. I spent a lot of time working in the Gentilly area/Upper 9th ward and used to stop into Zimmers pretty frequently. It's a charming family owned and operated spot that is usually jam packed during the lunch rush. If you're in a rush, it would definitely behoove you to order ahead so you don't spend your entire lunch break waiting in line. The staff is always very friendly and personable so sometimes, you actually forget how long you were waiting in line. Their marinated crab legs/claws are wonderful but for me, their true standout is the crab cake patty po'boy. I truly feel like it's the best seafood po'boy in town! It's incredibly filling (it has 3-4 crab cake patties) and will only run you about 12 bucks.  

Although I only have rave reviews about Zimmers, I am only going to give it 4 stars because of their hours. They are closed Sundays and Mondays and usually close at 6 so if you work a traditional M-F 9-5 you may not really have a chance to experience the magic of Zimmers, as you should."
352,Good food and friendly service! I love that they had lots of healthy options. My friend had veggie sausage - she said it was so good she wondered if it was really veggie! Lol. Great service from cute waiters!  It was worth the wait on a crowded Saturday morning.
353,"I am extremely picky when it comes to good quality pizza and am always on the look out for quality Italian pie's. Since I was a kid, I grew up with my best friends' family who are from Calabria. Their mom and grandma (spoke no English) would spoil us with the very beat home made Italian food I've ever had. She used to make multiple pizzas every Saturday...and placed a huge emphasis on the dough. Any true Italian always uses good bread and good dough for their food. With that being said, Vincent's is the best Pizza you can find outside of south Philly or center city. Very good dough and good use of cheese and sauce. Marras in south Philly is probably my favorite in the city."
354,"Nice atmosphere, good place to have dinner or drinks with a few friends. Vegan pulled 'pork' was not superb but pretty OK"
355,"I went to Desire Oyster Bar back in 2/2009 and really liked it.

I had three types of oysters here (BBQ, charbroiled with cheese, and raw).  The BBQ was good (fried with BBQ sauce and blue cheese)."
356,"Much love for this place! So why only 4 stars? Well, the chairs can be improved....that story at the end. 
Gabe and I went here at his suggestion for his ""better late than never"" birthday dinner. One of the few times I'm allowed to pick up the tab ;)
He opted for beer and I opted for wine. Both enjoyable. He got the special which was some kind of sweet and spicy fried chicken. I got the shrimp and grits. The portions were small for those used to large meals but for us, it was perfect. Left room for more beer later. 
Atmosphere was dark and cozy. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. Wait staff was friendly and efficient. Made reservations, arrived early and seated immediately. 
So about those chairs.... They're super cute but as I leaned over to grabbed my card that leaped off the table, I went down sloooowly. It was funny actually. A manager ran up to see if I was ok. Between my giggles, I told her ""yes"". Glad it wasn't a first date lol. 
So was it the wine that caused my graceful descend or the unsteady chair? Let's just say, not 5 mins later, a man at another table fell too....hahaha! I'm blaming the chairs."
357,Had the specialty BBQ shrimp and they were pretty good but didn't blow me away. Making the mess was fun and the sauce was well worth sopping up with the bread. What really impressed me about this place was the excellent and attentive service I got at the bar.
358,"CRAB RAGOONS! Need I say more? 

The highlight was the crab ragoons. These were the best of my life. They have a  large variety of Asian cuisine here. Everyone can find something they like on their menu. Also, I wanted to share that they have on stock my favorite beer from when I lived in China: Tsingtao!"
359,"You should eat here! We made a great decision stopping by for lunch provided my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our burger and BLT. In fact, there was nothing left on our plates. The burger's bun, caramelized onions, and meat were nearly perfect. The BLT's maple bacon was chewy, crunchy, and just sweet enough. I look forward to ordering french toast when we return to PA next year."
360,"Best late night snack on Indy's east side. This place has been around forever and has incredible hot Italian subs. I won't go to any other place after 10pm. It's a local, family owned business that has been a communication hub for locals to hang around and ""shoot the breeze."" Definitely a must try."
361,"Not health food, but they make their white pizza with enough garlic to burn off any impurties in your soul. You're already off your game if you've walked in there looking for healthy stuff anyway. Settle for fresh and be happy. Delish. 
They're super nice in there. 
Did I mention the chicken cheese steak? oh yes, its good, and they use fresh, not canned mushrooms. This is important. 
Nice vantage point of the passersby on the outside patio, or inside bar. Easy to eat there solo, or outside with a crown in nicer weather. yum."
362,"I'm not a coffee connoisseur so I'm not reviewing it based on that. What I am reviewing it on is the fantastic ambiance it has, the free wifi, and the long meeting table that's available for everyone.

Whenever I want to hang out and work downtown at a cafe, Roast is the first place I go to. 

My only real complaint is that during some hours, this place is PACKED and so that may put a kink in your plans if you wanted to meet someone there for a meeting. Also wifi is sometimes touch and go. I wish more cafes installed the fastest wifi with signal boosters around the place to make it more useful for those who telework.

I also love that this place is open LATE!"
363,"Went here after hoping on a plane. Quick lunch and had the Chicken Sandwich with fries. The bread on the sandwich was great. Chicken was normal but better than most. Atmosphere is a bit like a fast food place. Prices are slightly high so be aware of that. Other plates on the table were the Canelli' Special. They said the chicken was fantastic. They also liked the Yucca and rice. Would recommend if need a quick meal and the atmosphere is not an issue. Also, it's not a huge place."
364,"Couple of notable impressions:

- The first thing that got me was the decor of the place. Chopsticks were made out of red plastic, and the napkin was just paper, not cloth. Water came out in glass cups. The impression was overall a little cheap, which surprised me. On the other hand, the servers did keep water refilled well and tea was presented immediately.

- A lot of the reviews remark that the dishes are very spicy. I was surprised to discover it was pretty tame. The Dan Dan noodles come in at a 6 and it was imperceptible. We got another dish coming in at an 8 which also was hard to notice. Not sure what the explanation might be since I don't consider myself to be especially tolerant, but perhaps I'm more so than I think?

- Service was very fast. I think our food came out within ten minutes. Certainly the Dan Dan noodles were instantaneous.

- Finally, the food itself is delicious. The Dan Dan noodles especially. I also had some kind of dumplings and an entree, I unfortunately can't remember the names, but both were enjoyable as well.

- The bill was a bit pricey. I think they give a lot of food for two, so it's may be justified, just unwanted for two relatively small people. Fortunately, they make taking it home easy if that's something you'd like.

EDIT:

- After visiting a second time with a large group, I discovered they have a very nice seating area for groups (to the right and somewhat below ground). We got a circular table which I really liked for discussion. Definitely would have appreciated a turntable, but no big deal.

- A tip from our server: the spice tends to be the kind that creeps up rather than is entirely overt. Besides water, consuming tea and rice helps to reduce the effect of the spice."
365,Delicious!  Great ambiance.  Attentive staff.  Cool history (rumored to be haunted).  Great view of Jackson Square.
366,"Located at the Farmers Market in the French Market district. You basically order at the counter then pick up your food. There are a few patio tables/chairs where you can dine in as well.

Definitely get the peel and eat boiled crawfish and bbq shrimp!!! Freshest crawfish I've ever had and doesn't have an aftertaste that lingers. If you've never had crawfish, make sure you research how to open 'em up before you try 'em cause you'll be missing out. These crawdaddies are cooked with some vegetables (celery and onions) and it does have about a 6/10 spice to it; so I wouldn't recommend it to those who can't handle spice very well. I believe the market price was $12/lb so a bit pricier than other crawfish joints in NOLA. The BBQ boiled shrimp was very tasty as well! It came with bread drenched in garlic butter. My boyfriend and I also shared the crawfish beignets which were okay, it felt like they were sitting out for awhile waiting to be picked. These crawfish beignets resembles a hush puppy with a few pieces of crawfish tails inside. I would probably pass on them next time. Make sure to order yourself a side of fries too to sorta help fill your tummy up!

If you're trying out the peel and eat, make sure to bring some wet wipes/hand sanitizer to use right after. Restrooms are a bit tricky to locate. I believe the closest restroom would be in the flea market area of the French Market District."
367,"Great food, very helpful staff, small menu.  The clam bisque was the best, I also enjoy the fried oyster salad.  These two sides were enough food for me.  Salad had a little to much thick bacon chunks for me."
368,"I enjoyed the food here. I had the shrimp tom yum soup, which had a kick to it but was really delicious and then the sweet potato tempura roll and the avocado roll and it was all delcious. My friend enjoyed her meal as well, although, we both felt that it was a little too expensive and the parking lot is VERY small. 

The only downfall was the dessert, which was honestly terrible. I got the chocolate cake thing. I can't remember its official name but it was recommended by the waitress and it was honestly just terrible. The cake had obviously been microwaved and it was bland, which was a feat to suck the flavor out of chocolate cake. It had a scoop of ice cream on the side which tasted like it was a bit frost bitten and actually had chunks of ice in it. Not great.

On the bright side, the place is beautiful on the inside and the waitress was really friendly. We had the same girl both times we were there and I liked her and can overlook the poor dessert recommendation. 

I would go back and just stick to the sushi and rolls."
369,"To maximize the hot pot experience: come with a group of friends, take your time and prepare your favorite sauce.
Our group of 7 people occupied the big round table so we got enough table space for all the materials . I tried Coty S sauce recipe. It turned out quite delicious , I loved it. We ordered, cooked or grilled, ate, enjoyed the conversation. After 2 hours, my tummy was happy. We were each served a complementary small Yogurt drink. The services were good. They added venting vacuum on top of each small table, so the grilling was less smoky . Overall the materials were fresh . The selections were wide.  I enjoyed the hot pot meal."
370,The service is always on point and the coffee is the best.  Not to mention the great snacks and sandwhiches.  They put alot of hard work and time into making this place a great neighborhood spot.
371,"It took forever to be seated and its small, cramped and hot inside. On the plus side you can drink while you wait.
The server was really cool and very honest when we asked what was good and fresh for the day.
The food was cooked fresh!  I mean from being alive in the tank to killed and cooked right behind you. 
We ordered Lobster and rock crab both were amazing. We also had the lobster bisque which I thought needed more flavor.

The beer was ice cold and the food was hot and fresh. Service was outstanding once we actually got seated."
372,"I really enjoyed this hip pizza shop. The atmosphere was great. Hip hop was jamming in the background so we at the community tables could have great conversation. The wait staff was very knowledgeable and just wanted to customer to have a fabulous experience. Local beer, wine on tap, and delicious pizza. We ordered the prosciutto pie and Nutella dessert pie! Yum"
373,"I try to eat here every time I'm in Philly because it is some of the best Caribbean food I've ever had.

I pretty much get the same thing every time (jerk chicken with cabbage, peas and rice and plantains), but EVERYTHING they serve is good, from the basa fish to the brown stew chicken to the oxtails to the... well, you get the picture. 

And the price-to-portion-size ratio is awesome.
For eight bucks I get a Styrofoam container with the meal I mentioned earlier that is so full it will barely close.  
The young lady who prepared our order on my most recent visit had to force the boxes closed and double bag them just so we could get them home without them bursting open.  And we ordered the SMALL portions.

Now, as with any restaurant with good food it goes without saying that word travels.  As a result this place is always packed. ALWAYS. 
The line remains at two lengths: at the door or out the door.  So if you're impatient or adhering to the ""fast food"" mentality when it comes to restaurants, you may want to go elsewhere. 

But if you are willing to wait, it's oh so worth it."
374,Classic Mexican place. Meat was good and guacamole did not cost extra. Comparable to Chipotle but I think it was a little better. The music was too loud when I was there but that is my only complaint
375,"When I was in high school this was a regular market with a meat counter and limited groceries.  Now they specialize in take out sandwiches and I have to say the the quality of the rolls, meats and cheeses are top rate.  The large hoagie is enough for two and they will package onions, peppers etc on the side so you can share and still get your half the way you want it.  Our favorites are the Italian and the turkey with oil instead of mayo.  Call ahead as they can take a while to make, especially if you order several (we had four on Saturday).  Just wish they had brewed ice tea in addition to the bottled version."
376,"I'm definitely a fan.  The food/drinks are always stellar and while the staff is super friendly, the only issue with The Bricks is the time it takes to order/be served.  

It isn't like the servers are slow either, they are clearly working their assess off running from table to table, so maybe it is that people have called in sick the couple of times I've been in recently and they had to work twice as hard but a Sunday lunch shouldn't take 3 hours.  

Now that my complaining is out of the way, the restaurant itself is super groovy.  The kitchen is on full display so no crazy stories of chefs putting anything crazy into your food here.  And they look like they are having a great time while they prepare meals (whether they are or not, I love to see people enjoy what they do).  I normally get draft beer but their cocktails look really interesting and innovative.  

At lunch, I normally get the ""Goodness"" which is a hummus wrap and it comes with a choice of a side ($8).  Don't bother being wishy-washy on the side, get the Asian slaw, it is delicious, and if available I would order as a meal.  The wrap was good but the star was the slaw.  Thai, pea-nutty, goodness:)

I've gotten the Elvis before ($8) and it was delicious but something I can make a home.  I ordered it without bacon.  

My husband ordered the burrito and loved it as well ($9).  Others at our table raved about the Chicken and the Pig, The BBQ pork, and The Cure sandwiches.  Everyone really liked their food.  

The Bricks really is a great spot on the 7th Avenue strip, perfect for late night people watching that make Ybor awesome and also out of the way enough to not feel like it's distinctly part of the Ybor scene."
377,"Our intention was to go to Rooster.. but the wait at noon on a Sunday was 45 minutes.. crazy. So I pulled out Yelp to see what other downtown options I have and it suggested Blondie's. I love the laid back attitude and funky furniture. Boyfriend had a bagel and cream cheese and a blueberry pancake off the kids menu. He enjoyed himself.. I had the banana french toast.. very good but very sweet.. I think I would have enjoyed this as a half order and had something savory as well. 
Loved the bottle service for mimosa's. Had a $25 bottle of champagne and unlimited orange juice (great juice!). We will be back for sure!"
378,"Went in for lunch and tried the jerk chicken and curry goat.  My friend LOVED her goat and to surprise, the jerk chicken had been cooked on the pit and was delicious!  Ive been searching for jerk ckicken and every place cooks it in the oven?!! So happy to find a spot where the chicken is done right! Only draw back was that it was a lil dried out. If it wasnt for that, it would have been nearly perfect.  Will def come back!"
379,"First time we've been here.  The bar tender was great and steered us to some great eats.  Had the sweet potato fries which were great, I had a Trident burger and onion rings.  It was huge and very good.  Wife had fish and chips.  Nice breading and fries were great.

We'll be back."
380,"This is one of our frequent late-night stops, after we've gotten tired of the loud bars and are looking for a more quiet but still lively place to wrap up a night. We always go on Saturday nights and have never had to wait for a spot at the bar.

I actually don't drink liquor, so village WHISKEY may seem like an odd choice of locations, but they have a fantastic beer selection too. Honestly, I stopped here because it's a Garces joint and I would drink toilet water if he put it in a bowl with some cilantro. Plus, my boyfriend loves their whiskeys. And so do the other guests, which makes this place so fun: the last time we were there we ended up joining booths with our neighbors so that we could all talk about the restaurant and their liquor choices. It's a very cool, very like-minded crowd.

Food wise you can't go wrong with duck fat french fries. I feel like I don't even need to say that, because come on... duck. fat. french. fries. We also go for the cheese puffs on their late night menu as well: a hot pan of ping-pong ball sized bread balls coated in cheese and broiled and delicious and... oh boy now I'm, hungry.

And if the other reviews aren't clear enough... their burgers will have you singing hymns of praise to the meat gods."
381,"Gluten free pasta...I had to try. Plus, 1/2 price wine Mon-Thurs did not disappoint.  The selection was just right.

We found street parking as the lot was full, and at 7pm waited a bit for a table as they don't accept reservations for parties of less than 6.

To start, we ordered the Escargot, and it came from the kitchen screaming hot. So hot, the cheese had broken. I was looking forward to the crunchy brown bits to munch on but only had a couple of small bits that survived.  As a celiac, I couldn't dunk for the garlic butter, and they didn't bring any bits for my dining companion to dunk after I had finished.  Our server was MORE than helpful, we could have asked, but wondered if this was how it was usually served.

Next I ordered the daily special - squid, mussels and shrimp with a garlic butter sauce and gluten free penne corn pasta.  I'm not usually a fan of a single ingredient gluten free pasta - corn tends to be a bit dry and fussy.  Tonight was not much of an exception.  

Tasty? Oh my YES. But again, without (gluten free) bread or bun to soak up that beautiful garlic butter sauce - a bit sad.  The seafood was cooked to perfection, and I don't get to say that very often.  The penne... well, stab it with a fork and some broke in half. A large spoon would have been a great addition to the dish for scooping.  I think I managed OK, because I ate almost all of it and forgot to take pictures!

My dining companions all finished their meals and had desserts which looked fantastic - tiramisu was beautiful and large! Some would share it, but for others, it's just right. 

Be prepared to leave by 9:30pm on a Thursday, as the cleaners apparently come soon after! (I've never heard that before, but...Ok.)

Not every establishment can handle gluten free ingredients or diners, but they did well.  They weren't certain if the gelato was safe, and probably cross-contamination from others might be an issue, so good call by our waitress.  I'm looking forward to the single serving packages of buns from certain gluten free bakers (wink wink) that might make it easier for restaurants to thaw only one at a time (yes, you have to keep them frozen until serving - they get dried out, inedible and gross pre-thawed).

I believe we will return to try more items on their menu."
382,"Let me just say this. If this place was in the South, it would be okay at best. But this isn't. This is the Midwest of the Midwest. So I'm giving it a 4 star because these people have pushed it to the very point of being as Cajun/NOLA/Southern as they can with the demographic thats around. Anything more involving fried oysters, more crawfish, more fried anything, hard cajun spices, LSU and Saints decor, the locals wouldn't come. So I give them a thumps up for making it as close as Carmel-Indy will allow to stay in business.

Now the food, its good. Not awesome, but I don't expect it to be. I had the pick three; Crawfish Casserole, Gumbo and Jambalaya. All fair sizes, all had a little kick. I would go again on my way through Carmel. More of a lunch place than dinner, but thats up to you.

I hope they stay open and continue to grow.

Laissez les bons temps rouler !"
383,Good coffee. Great cheesecakes and ice cream. Awesome to be able to walk / bike to get a cuppa.
384,Turkey Club was excellent. Quaint.  Good service. Just across from the beaches. Check it out. Big menu. Recommended.
385,"A little outside of downtown Indianapolis is an area called Broad Ripple, and here you can find a place that transports you to a modern pristine Parisian bakery. You literally walk in and no longer feel like you are in Indiana. Everything is sparkly and glittery, and the smells are divine. 

We made the trek by uber to this neighborhood and really wanted to try this place! We arrived around 11 for an ""early lunch"" slash ""snack"". We ordered the quiche of the day which was quiche Lorraine and the famous Earls Court Chocolate Cake.

The quiche was quite delicious. The egg was so fluffy and savory while the crust was super flaky and had a great bacon flavor.  This was a perfect snack to split between 2 people and just hit the spot!

It was so hard to decide which cake to try. One gripe that I have about this place is the price of the cake slices. The slices are quite large and pricey. If you only come with 2 people it is hard to get a few things to share without either breaking the bank or stuffing your face with dessert. I asked if we could do 1/2 slices, but was politely denied. A suggestion I have would be to allow fractions of slices so people can try multiple different cakes.

My wife loves chocolate and I love all sweets so we opted for the famous chocolate cake. There was so much great chocolate flavor and for the most part, the cake was super moist. It seemed like the edges of the cake might have been a little over cooked/on the dryer side but the flavor was delightful!"
386,"AJs products are incredible. Fresh, clean, super. Just look at the labels and realize what you are getting. You pay more, but you pay for what you get, and that's a lot. Want organics and quality? Incredible fruit and veggies section. Amazing beer and wine (my mouth watered at the $450 bottle of Dom Perignon!) There is amazing looking sushi prepared fresh. I bought a tiny baguette that is the freshest and tastiest bread I have ever eaten. The selection is amazing, you will find things from all over the world. They get rare and unusual items so it costs more. 

I don't think AJs is snobby. I did get some weird looks from the employees when I showed up in my ratty shirt and shoes, but I know what I want there and get great quality things that go into my body. And there are better and better deals the more you show up, just like any other grocery store. I'd rather get some things here than anywhere else in town. AJ's is a place to explore more. And there are no homeless people or ghetto customers in line , which I love!

I probably can't or won't shop here too often since, you know, I like to pay rent and bills and stuff. But for specialty items and rarer beers and things, this is the place. It's also fun to browse. Totally good times."
387,"I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars, but have decided to go with the more generous offering?  Why?  Because this place has one of the most generous menus as far as choices go.  There is a ton to choose from, even if you're vegetarian.  
Formalities first--why can't there be some ambiance at Indian restaurants.  I know I'm painting with broad strokes here, but it seems like outside of NYC, no Indian restaurant in the US can get creative with their dining space.  Not sure why that is, but whatever.
An early arrival on a Sunday found the place quiet, with maybe 10 or so people dining.  No problem getting a table for 2.  We started the evening off with some garlic Naan.  Delicious, although I think next time I'll stick with regular, at almost half the cost.  We also got some Finger Paneer, little spiced fried cubes of cheese.  These were denser than typical Paneer.  The cheese was slightly bland, but the spices were good.  Overall, an enjoyable start to the meal.  I also had a lemonade, which may have been made fresh.  Regardless, it was tasty. 
Entrees included Paneer Bhurji and Lamb Shahi Korma.  We elected ""spicy"" as our seasoning level.  I'll admit, I have a pretty strong ability to deal with spiciness.  But this was some ultra-spicy food when it arrived!  We quickly ordered a mango lassi to help put out the fire.  Still, even through the spices, there were decent flavors coming through.  The nutiness of the Korma was especially nice, as was the blended creaminess.
I'm intrigued enough to return for more offerings.  I am humbled however by their spiciness--something that has not happened to me in many many years.  Next time, I am going to stick with ""medium"" spiciness!"
388,"Had the rock crab, oysters, and sea urchin. Every dish tasted like heaven. The beer was ice cold and the staff was so nice. Our pup joined us sitting outside and enjoyed a smidge of crab for herself. I love this place"
389,"Outstanding food and service. The only challenge was that one plate came late so we didn't get to eat together. Overall though a great experience and we will be back!

My wife and I had breakfast combo number one and it was awesome. A lot of food!!!

My son had steak fajitas and he really enjoyed it. 

Can't wait to come back"
390,"We got takeout from here last night for dinner and I was really impressed! I've had Thai from a lot of the places around Brandon and typically I wind up disappointed.....most places aren't authentic and just really lack. This was not the case for Jasmine Thai. The main reason I took the star is because their crab rangoons were a bit dry. But my husband had the Chicken Basil and I had the Chicken Panang Curry and they were both wonderful. Also I must comment on the decor inside, they could use new carpeting but other than that it was one of the nicest Thai restaurants I've seen."
391,"This restaurant gets its name from the fresh olive bread they serve - which is wonderful! The menu is rooted in old world Mediterranean fare, but has a slight modern flair, too. The weather was wonderful, so even though the outside eating area overlooks the parking area, we opted to sit outside. The grape vines on the trellises were beautiful and healthy and just about to burst into fruit! 

Our entrees included the walnut encrusted trout, seafood linguine - clams, shrimp, white fish, mussels, over bed of linguine, and a lamb kofte special.  The trout was a healthy serving and perfectly prepared. Clams, mussels and shrimp over a bed of linguine was another healthy portion and half ended up in a to-go box! Again, delicious, attractively presented and perfectly prepared.  Lamb is a personal favorite, but if I had it to do over again, I would've opted for something else. It tasted ok (meat was a bit dry)  but less than appealing appearance-wise: looked like two crisscrossed sausages. It came with a very thin (runny) yogurt cucumber sauce - not the standard tzatziki one would expect. Entrees will run you about $22, pastas around $16-18, so it's not overly pricey, but the addition of a couple adult beverages or bottle of wine can change that in a heartbeat.

All in all, it's a nice place with good food and attentive service. We all voted we would be back."
392,"This is a great vegan place to come and dine. When I walked in I thought the place was especially clean and welcoming. Everything I've tried from this place I thought was delightful. I have had the chicken burger, ziggy burger, their smoothie and the sweet potato fries. If all vegetarian food tasted this good, I would seriously consider becoming one."
393,"I stopped in the evening of St. Patty's just to check this place out & see what they have to offer.  A ""Whiskey Bar"" it is!  A nice wooden bar to your left upon walking in, with small tables dispersed around the perimeter of the restaurant.   They offer a solid selection of whiskey & bourbon at reasonable prices.  The bar staff was very knowledgeable and will help you make a decision if your not a connoisseur. 
  I toyed with the idea of going with a whiskey flight but I was tight on time.  My experience was great, and I look forward to going back here to explore their food options."
394,"Great food! From the outside, the building is kind of nondescript. Inside set up just like a diner. Lots of selection for breakfast lunch and dinner, great service, coffee and food really good. Would definitely go back."
395,"I was staying downtown for work, and I needed to grab lunch before a meeting.  I walked into Sun Diner, a pretty new spot at the time, because there aren't a ton of restaurants downtown with awesome reviews.  This one looked intriguing, and I love breakfast food any time of day.  I loved the decor and layout!  Really fitting for Music City, delightfully retro.  Most of the seating is at the counter, which is casual and laid back.  

The food was pretty good.  I had a breakfast burrito.  The potatoes surprised me because there were sweet ones in the mix, not bad.  I got the wrong tea from my server at first, but it was corrected pretty easily.  Prices are on par for downtown, touristy Nashville.  Steep but expected.

My one complaint is that I had to pay at the register, which is located by the door, and there just isn't much space there if there's a line.  I kept bumping into people entering the restaurant while I waited.

Overall, I'd say this is a safe bet when you're downtown, and I think it would taste even better at 3am.  After all, it's a 24-hour diner!"
396,Love sitting at this bar. Mezcal Mule is really nice summer drink. I'd recommend the Salsa verde doused chilaquiles with steak/chicken & egg. Fish tacos were great as was the chorizo & steak pizza app. Good prices for high quality
397,I've been here twice within the past two weeks... AND I LOVE IT! Each time trying something different. So far I love the chili burger. That was first time trying chili on a burger and I must say it won't be my last.  During the week they have a nice happy hour with local brews on the menu.. So that's a plus.
398,Burger was great but not the best I have ever had. Good service and ambiance. Had their salad special and wasn't my favorite but most likely because it was different than I had pictured. Slightly overpriced. Happy I tried but too many great places to return again
399,"We took a break from Sesame Place and ate some real food here before heading back to Elmo for a final beating, aka: The Sesame Parade and Fireworks show. 

If this wasn't the sweet haven of amazingness between furry monsters and sweat, I really cannot attest to what the heck a sweet haven is. 

I ate steak, delicious steak, instead of a grilled cheese at Elmo-Bites. Because I found out that Elmo can really bite. He is a monster after all. 

The servers are so great with kids and yet you sit in that swanky dark mahogany bar atmosphere and feel like you are human again after a day at Sesame Place. I actually think JB DAWSON's is the reason we went back after our dinner. I downed my steak and two beers, looked at my adorable 3 year old who was quietly coloring on the kid menu they have, turned to my husband and said, ""Wanna be parents of the year, and take her back to see the parade?"" Swiftly, he responded, ""Let's do it. Go big or go home.""

All the waitstaff works together here too. I don't know if they pool tips, but it's like some sorta family feeling they give you as if the waitress' big brother just took over her shift so she could go help mom in the kitchen. So rare to find fast, efficient, and dependable hosting like that in a restaurant these days. 

Being from New York City and eating at an array of places over the years (with plenty of annoyed waitstaff), this place reminded me of Gorgios of Gramercy in terms of atmosphere and service. And it was child friendly which always scores well with me.

My only constructive criticism: my newborn has a dairy allergy and an overwhelming majority of the dishes and sides have butter, milk, or cheese in them. They made me a beautiful plate of steak, but all the higher priced sides I was supposed to get, I could not have. So I paid the same amount for two less filling sides....basically steamed broccoli (which was actually amazing) and fries. An additional side of something small like corn or rice, would have made it even-steven. But I loved my meal. I'd go back."
400,"As soon as my boyfriend landed in New Orleans to meet me for our vacation we had one mission - find a restaurant with happy hour and buck-a-shuck oysters.  Luke happened to be close by (we stayed at Le Pavillon Hotel), had a happy hour, and had oysters, so we headed that way.  Found out when we got that that happy hour included $.50 oysters.  SCORE!

Luke is a great restaurant with cool decor.  The food was absolutely fantastic, the drinks were spot on and worth every penny (especially during happy hour), and the service was fantastic.  Highly recommended!"
401,"Good food, family ok, kids love it
Chicken buffalo
Pastrami 
Recommended
Take your time at lunch need 30 to 40 min"
402,"I first heard of this place from a dude I know, and then I heard Craig LaBan called it the best burger in the city. That must be the $26 burger that I didn't have (mainly because I'm not a fan of bleu cheese, and I didn't want to be ""that guy"" to ask for a different cheese) because the Village Burger was good, but not exceptional.

I got the ""Village Burger"" (8oz, Sesame Roll, Tomato, Boston Bibb, House Made Thousand Island) with bacon and provolone (+$3). It was huge, could hardly fit in my mouth huge, and delicious, but I don't think I can call it the best burger in all of Philadelphia.

The duck fat fries were great. They were big, crispy, and hot on the inside. I'm going to get the sly fox cheddar sauce with them next time.

The whiskey list is HUGE. 

It's so small inside they don't have ""sections"" for the waitresses (or it might have been because only the bar and outside seating were busy). There's the bar that seats maybe eight people, though I didn't count (it was full), four or five booths (completely empty at 5:30pm), and a little counter that seats five or six in the back (empty as well). There's more seating outside than inside. After paying one waitress, another asked if I wanted another beer. I'm not sure if it's a plus that there's always someone checking on you, or a negative because they're unorganized? 

 I'll come back, but my main goal will be to try the extensive whiskey list, not a burger."
403,"During my visit last week, I ate so many shrimp tacos I couldn't walk. In retrospect, I should have been overjoyed, because I would have had an excellent excuse to post up in the dingy (charming?) dining room and eat so many shrimp tacos I couldn't breath. It would have been worth it, because they're awesome. 

During dinner, $8.00 and tax gets you three tacos of your choice, beans, rice, pickled onions and radishes, limes, and a 16 oz. cup of fresh juicy heaven. I went with shrimp, my husband mixed it up with fish and shrimp. Lemme break it down: 

Tortillas: Fresh, handmade, substantial without being dense. Impossibly moist and flexible. How are these not crumbling apart in my hand? This is a tortilla that can stand up to some serious manhandling, which is exactly what I did to my tacos. I would like to note that I would manhandle these on their own as a snack, or filled with cheese and green chiles. 

Shrimp: Crispy until the end. Moderately battered. I won't say lightly - someone's dragging these through the batter with a heavyish hand, but I'm happy to say they're cooked perfectly and thoroughly enough that you don't encounter any flavorless globs of doughy disappointment. Just pure, deep fried ecstasy. 

Sauce: White sauce of indeterminable origin. Mayonnaise? Vinegar? Crema? DELICIOUS. Cooly, tangy, and sour in the best way possible. Really the great unifier - bringing together while still accentuating the hot, crispy, shrimp, crunchy cabbage, and dense corn tortilla. 

Beans & Rice: Solid. Substantial. You're going to eat them. 

Horchata: Dude said people show up just for the horchata and I believe him. This doesn't come out of a fountain, and I'm not just saying that because I watched as it got ladled out of some giant tub resting on the counter top. You can taste the rice. This drink has texture, and what appears to be giant, lovely flecks of cinnamon bark. 

Pina/Mango Juice: Fortifying. So tasty. Chunks of fresh pineapple. This might be my new Gatorade. 

Taqueria Pico De Gallo, come onnnnnnnn. Why so good?"
404,"I can't overstate how much I love Crumb De La Crumb's cafe. This is my go-to, absolute favorite lunch spot in all of Tennessee. I live in Mt Juliet but travel the 30 miles to Bellevue to indulge in the delightful fare. My personal favorite? Charleston She Crab soup and chicken salad on a croissant. Heaven I tell you, heaven! 

If you haven't checked this place out yet, you're seriously missing out. Go now!!

Reason for an imperfect review: Two things.
1. The check out process is usually very time consuming. I normally wait 5-10 minutes in line before being able to pay my bill and leave. You have to go up front and pay which is fine but usually, the patrons in line are slowly picking out different desserts to purchase at the same time. There's only one cashier, usually the same lady. I don't know her name but she always seems down or unhappy. Which is always frustrating because the servers are usually very sweet and helpful. 

2. I wrote a review several years ago on their old Yelp name ""The Cottage Cafe"", but they have since changed their official name to Crumb De La Crumb to keep in sync with the dessert side of their business. Maybe I've always had bad luck with the desserts but I've tried many of the bars and cupcakes and always found a serious fault with them. For instance, a red velvet cupcake I had was extremely dry (like it had been baked a few days before) and the icing wasn't as sweet as you'd hope for a cream cheese icing. 

TL;DR The cafe side is phenomenal but the check-out process and desserts are lacking."
405,"Love this place, it's a casual Hispanic place with great family style food. I call it family style as I feel like I am eating at a Hispanic friend's house and their grandma is cooking. They have a bunch of fresh quick favorites in the steam table like roast pork and yellow rice or black beans and rice, but today I picked something I have had there before and loved, chicken fingers. I know crazy right? But it's the best and always fresh made. They make it like my grandma, fresh breaded and quick fried. That and a side of rice and nice big bowl of their amazing Spanish Bean soup/ garbanzo and I am in culinary heaven. This is my go to place for great comfort food. Cubans are pretty good here too. But I go there on the days when they have Spanish Bean soup and I would put theirs up against any of the good ones in Ybor City, yes it is that good, but sadly not on the menu every day. Call ahead, I do. Try it and they got ya!"
406,"Got the apple and bacon pizza. It was really delicious, but the toppings slid off the pizza really easy, so you had to hold it really well to avoid that. The outdoor seating was very nice and the heaters worked well. The waitress seemed a little annoyed, but it was not a big problem. There was no wait on a Sunday night, so we were seated very quickly. Overall a nice experience."
407,"Ate breakfast here 11/13/2013. The line mid-morning on a weekday was a bummer, but testament to the popularity of the place - and for good reason. Forget everything else on the menu, just be sure to order the sweet potato pancakes with the cinnamon cream. It's the best experience you'll ever have with your clothes on. Service was prompt (once seated) if a little brusque. Dining area is clean and attractive. Food came out hot and well presented. The eggs were fine, the sausage nothing brilliant. My partner had some southwest style cornmeal pancakes and loved them. But forget all that. The place is a 3 star rating at best but the pancakes make it a special meal."
408,"Glad to have a location closer to home,  The bbq is consistently good, especially the pork and turkey.  A good option for take-home dinners when you're tired of the same old fast food."
409,"We really enjoyed our visit to Pizzeria Vetri.  The group split four pies, Margherita, Crudo, Quattro Formaggi and Renato.  They all tasted great, I think the Margherita and Crudo were our two favorites.  Good beer selection and the Fried Pizza Dough dessert was a nice ending to fun night out.  

PV is quite small with little waiting space, the bar Kite & Key across the street is a good spot to wait and have a drink."
410,"Came here for lunch on a very cold day, convenient location right around the corner from my office. A had a few co-workers tag along so we ordered to-go.

It's nice they have two options for ordering, a self serve kiosk as well as though a cashier. We all opted for the kiosk. 

Really interesting the deluxe pho is the same price as all of the others. I found this as a bonus because I prefer multiple goodies over choosing only one protein.

Service was quick but we found ourselves waiting around for those who ordered bahn mi sandwiches. When we got back to the office everything was packaged great, no spills etc. I liked that they give you all the sprouts, noodles, basil etc in a separate bowl...however you'll find at the bottom of that bowl is a tiny plastic cup of hoisin. Not sure why they decide to hide it at the bottom, but some of my overeager coworkers poured their broth in before fishing it out!

I was really happy with the pho I thought it was super flavorful and I will definitely be back soon!"
411,"So I came here after all the hoopla on the foobooz site and because Matyson is an awesome byob(and who doesn't love delicious noodles). I have to say, had the burger and pork belly buns and they were excellent. Also had the BBQ crisp appetizer that had a great flavor yet it needed something to soak up the sauce. Finally had the lamb braised noodles and they were great. Again I wanted to soak up every ounce of the sauce. They should go against the norm and serve a nice crusty bread- blasphemy you might say but seriously something must be done to soak up these flavors.

Now onto the bad part, the prices.  Way too expensive for everything. Nan Zhou hand drawn noodles Isn't that far away and their delicious noodles are 3-5 bucks depending on either the peanut or soy pork sauce; Cheu's prices are around 11-15, and small to boot. Also sampan isn't far away with a great priced happy hour. I know Cheu is just starting up, so hopefully after a time they will be a little more affordable.

This place is great with a comfy feel and a warm and inviting staff.  I will be back, just not often or I'll be broke."
412,"Grilled peppered prawn appetizer - 5 stars
Stuffed pork chop over risotto - 4 stars 
Mahi Mahi grilled - 4 stars
Service - 4 stars

Very place with a great lively atmosphere. We came here on a Thursday night at 8pm without reservations and they were nice enough to seat us quickly. Service overall is very good and the servers seem to enjoy working here which really shows in their performance.

Some of their entrees are a little over priced for their type, but you get enough food for two entrees. I would recommend dropping the size of the larger entrees (14oz pork chop is just too much) by 30% and take $7 off the price. This would be much easier to swallow."
413,"Great service and amazing food. Will always go back here. The first time we went we didn't realize it was a dressy restaurant and showed up in jeans and t-shirts. Anticipating being at least relegated to a Siberia-like table we were pleasantly surprised to be put in the center of the dining room, and the servers treated us really, really well. After several return trips ( dressed appropriately!) I can tell you that all their servers I have had are very knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list, and the food is ridiculously good. Their turtle soup alone is worth going for. We often will order a bunch of their small plates because their menu is too damn interesting! Highly reccomend."
414,"$0.75 oysters everyday 3-6 pm! This is a great deal if you like P&J oysters. We also ordered the crawfish bisque which was creamy smooth. We shared the rib eye entree, seasoned well and came with decent fries. There was some lulls in the service."
415,"It's no secret that backyard bowls is a favorite in town, and with reason.  Their acai bowls are really good, everything is fresh and tasty!  All of the bowls I have tried are great and they can be very filling.  The large is A LOT.  Minus one star just because it's pretty pricey so it's not something I get on a regular basis."
416,"I am glad I was able to join friend for their reservations at Luke. The drinks were wonderful! First time having raw and fried oysters, I was told the raw oysters were less salty then regular which I appreciated. I had the crab bisque which was divine, tried my friends shrimp and grits, and the bread pudding, all were glorious and to top it off the serves was great."
417,Holy Moly!   Huge amount of food.  I ordered the Cuban special with fries 6$  definitely worth every dime.  I was staving and this was a great little whole in the wall.  Décor was a little outdated.  The waitress was so pleasant and friendly we chatted the whole time I was waiting for my order - I must say it was fast ... a definite stop over place that I will go to again.
418,"So far, so good, Biscuit Love! I have to admit, though: I am worried about reviewing this Biscuit Love location, because it is completely possible that it will end up with lines just as long as its Gulch location!

We arrived to Biscuit Love at 8:30am on a Saturday. To our pleasant surprise, there was zero wait! That alone earns you a star, Biscuit Love! In addition, the self-serve sparkling and still water machine is a nice touch.

I ordered the Princess with an egg on top. Trust me, hot chicken and eggs for breakfast is a gorgeous & delicious thing! I devoured the entire meal in very short order. 

The only problem I could find was the coffee. It tasted burnt and left something to be desired. Then again, if you are going to Biscuit Love for its coffee, you're doing it all wrong!

From what I can tell, this location is something of a ""locals secret."" I did not see any obvious tourists here. If you ARE a tourist, though - welcome to Nashville! I highly encourage everyone who reads this review, locals and tourists alike, to visit this location instead of the one in the Gulch."
419,"We just moved to this area of town, and thought we would give this place a try.  We have now been 2 times in the same week.  If you aren't used to spicy foods, be very careful when selecting their heat levels of 0-5.  A heat level of 1 was hotter than I expected, but I'm a wimp.  Totally worth the burn, though!  Definitely a place I'm putting on my frequent rotation of favorites.  Service wasn't awesome, but that could have been based on the time of day.  Try not to run out of your drink, though!"
420,"Lots of good options in this area and the tavern is definitely one of them.  I came here for drinks one night and lunch during the day.   A bit of a wait for dinner so make sure you get a reservation if you can.

We got an appetizer - buffalo cauliflower.  It's slightly breaded and engulfed in buffalo sauce.  Good taste, but would've preferred to have it a bit crispier.  

Ordered the burger - cooked medium, lettuce, tomato, American (cheese is extra).  The fries were okay - comes in a little fryer basket.  The burger had a good sear on the outside and properly seasoned with salt.  

Good spot for food and drinks."
421,"Startlingly good! The rotisserie chicken was delightful. Service was a little slow, but it was good-natured, so I can't complain too much, I suppose. I'd definitely go back."
422,"Came here once with friends and enjoyed the coconut margarita, the creamiest tableside  guacamole made to my liking served with yummy fresh and warm thin tortilla chips and free churros!! I ordered a salad but the chicken was dry and the dressing (requested on the side) didn't please me. I even asked for another dressing but still didn't quite hit the spot. I'd definitely come back for the margaritas, guac/chips and churros though!"
423,"For some reason this place makes me feel like I am on the set of the Wonder Years every time I eat there. The décor is busy and outdated and the food is damn good! It is a quick soulful lunch that you can finish for under $10 and in less than an hour. Always a good range of characters from businessmen, quarter workers, and tourist who aren't corny and want a decent cheap meal. You won't be ripped off here and the food will stick to your ribs and soak up your current or ever-looming hangover."
424,Food is superior. Mel's Chicken Cutlet sandwich is everything you want in a cutlet sandwich. Perfectly cooked chicken with the best roll. Try it. The only drawback is the noise. It's deafening at peak meal times. They have to hang some noise absorbing panels somewhere. A great place to eat when it's not crowded. And it gets crowded!!
425,"I would have given 5 stars in the past (and probably would give 5 stars to the chestnut location), but recently I feel there's been a decline in quality.  I went in recently and their signature crispy ranch was soggy with no crunch.  Their fries were great, well seasoned.  Yet I felt the entire meal wasn't worth the 14.50.  

I did have to walk 3 blocks, which may have caused some of the issue with the sandwich.  The fries and good customer service save this from being 3 stars in my mind, but the price prevents it from a 5 star.  Avoid peak hours."
426,I love this place.  Everything I've had seems really fresh.  The hummus is really tasty and the ambiance is nice and relaxed.
427,"Nestled on the corner of 20th and Chestnut, it looks bigger than what you'll discover inside. A tight-knit community of tables, all filled, whether reservations can be made or not, saddled around a long bar, and some standing room to place your beer and food, if standing is fine. 

Wander in at 6:00 on a Saturday, and are told its a 2 hour wait for a table. Bar is a much better option. Was able to grab a seat at the bar as soon as we got in. 

Bartenders are friendly. The wall of whiskey (or whisky) behind the bar is quite impressive. 

Food is quite delicious. Village burger with sauteed onions and blue cheese is quite the tasty treat. Burger is cooked a shade under what you request, which for medium, a bit redder is fine by me. The wife got a pulled pork sandwich, and salivated over every bite. A side order of duck fat fries in a cheese sauce compliments the meal well. 

Pricing is surprisingly reasonable. Definitely on the list as a repeat place to go."
428,"My favorite local go-to place for yummy grub.  Ants Pants has not disappointed me yet! Food is always delicious and price is good. Love, love their shoe string fries! Salads are fresh and sandwiches are fancy. I give it 4 stars because they do not accept credit cards; it is cash only and they do have an ATM machine."
429,"(to the tune of ""The Mack"" by Nevada feat Mark Morrison and Fetty Wap)

Yelpers tried to tell me so (yes they did)
But I didn't wanna go
""Gotta car?"" gotta say no.
But my mouth wanted to know.
Yeah, I felt it from the start.
From my tummy to my heart
When my sister was in town
We were headed to chow down.

No lies to me 
(All those reviews weren't kidding)
No lies to me
Oh my god baby...
Take a bite!

Blue Duck, it's like Quack (once again)
Blue Duck, it's like Quack (top of the charts)
Blue Duck, it's like Quack (gotta go)
You know that I'll be back....
Blue Duck, it's like Quack.

Wow. Worth the trip is an understatement. While the schlep was a bit out of my usual trip for eats, my baby sister is all about that burger, and we'd heard only the best. We went later in the day, around 2pm, but service was still incredibly slow (frustrating because there weren't a ton of folks inside, but maybe they were recovering?) This resulted in us getting our duck fat cheese fries WAY before our burgers. We TRIED  to wait for the burgers, but our stomachs rumbling drowned out that idea. The mac and cheese, the cheese fries, the burger.... Every bite was perfect. I only wish that the food came out all at once like we asked. Oh well....

The Beast of Northeast (Philly) [wild boar and beef patty, smoked gouda, sweet tomato jam, crispy sriracha onions, and bacon on brioche] was insane and, IMHO, tastier than her pork roll burger, but that pork roll was sizzled to perfection. 

I'll be back for the Quack and Cheese, next time a buddy with a car is feeling adventurous. Hopefully they can speed up the service a bit, don't want all that gouda sauce getting cold!"
430,"Went here last week on my first trip to New Orleans.  It's a very fancy place, although my friends and I were in t-shirts.  The atmosphere is great, and the food was very good.  Since I was in N.O., I wanted to eat seafood and other traditional Cajun fare.  As I suspect most people do, I ordered the 3-course meal for $30.  The fried gator tail appetizer was very good, not too much breading.  I also tasted my friend's seafood gumbo, which was also quite good.  For my main course, I had the seafood au gratin, which was extremely rich (and very tasty).  I also tasted a friend's shrimp creole, which was only ok.  The bread pudding desert was excellent (very dense).  My friend ordered the brownie - don't waste your time.  All-in-all, I left with a full stomach of very good Louisiana food at a reasonable price."
431,"I've never had any meal here other than pizza, and I probably never will.  Their pizza is just *that* good.

I grew up in Maryland, and whenever our family got pizza, it was from Ledo's.  After driving by this location on Dale Mabry multiple times, and laughing at the coincidence of a pizza place using the same name as my favorite place in MD, I looked it up online and realized it IS the same place.  Woo hoo!  I've been here three times now, and the pizza is just like I remembered, and just as good as I hoped it would be.

To start with - the pizza is square, and the pieces are cut into little squares.  It's thin crust, which is my favorite kind of pizza, as I hate filling up on dough.  The red sauce is sweet, and very distinctive.  I've tried all different varieties of pizza here, but I always come back to the classic pepperoni pizza.  Each individual square piece of pizza gets it own thick cut slice of pepperoni on top.  Heaven!  Then, before you know it, you've eaten multiple squares, and you roll out the door, fat and happy.

Service was good, waitress was friendly, and stopped by frequently to make sure we had what we needed.  I do wish they supplied better quality paper napkins, as I went through about 1 per slice, but at least they are on the table to grab as many as you need.  Long and short of it - you know I'll be back!"
432,"This place started for us as a quick stop to grab a bubble tea for my wife and I. It was nice and convenient, located very close to my wife's work. On days that I would show up early to pick her up from work, I would find myself coming up with excuses to get a bubble tea for her and a smoothie for myself. This practice has aided in earning me a brownie point or two over the years. The quality of the smoothie/ bubble tea bar is 5-star.

About 1 year ago a Taiwanese friend of ours paid us a visit, and we decided to try the actual restaurant. They have plenty of the typical American Chinese food such as orange chicken, but our friend recommended actual Taiwanese dishes. The results were a little mixed. Some of the dishes were absolutely amazing, while others were quite weird. Overall the quality was very good (based on the opinion of our Taiwanese friend), even if some of the dishes were a little outside our comfort zone.

To sum it up, if you want a good bubble tea or smoothie, you won't find much better in Reno. If you want to give legitimate Taiwanese food a try, this is a great place to start."
433,"The service was warm and friendly, but not overly cloying. Food wasn't spectacular,  but it was good, a step up from typical pub food. It was satisfying. The atmosphere is very nice, upscale, comfortable and yet stylish."
434,"Ate here twice in one week. In NOLA, that's an endorsement.  Our waiter, Ritchie, was memorable.  ""Christian Mingle""..... What a line!  I will try other Besh restaurants if I have to,,,,but Luke will be hard to beat."
435,"My crew and I absolutely love this place. We frequent here on Thursday nights for Quizzo. Delicious, reasonably priced food, good atmosphere, and great service. My only criticism is that they don't offer a bar menu. It would be nice to see the different beers on tap and cocktails offered. Other than that, a great, local bar!"
436,"My review is from a Sat brunch visit. I've never been at night so it could be quite good as a bar to frequent.

That said their breakfast was OK, nothing to write home about - in fact there's a cafe right across the street (cafe lift) and I would argue they have a much more tasty brunch option. That said this place definitely has great options for watching games and seating with groups at a bar."
437,"4.5 stars.  I had to deduct half a star for the service.  We got seated in great time but the waiter ignored us for a good 20 minutes then kept forgetting things we asked for.. like water.

Other than that, we got the eggs benedict, basic breakfast plate with eggs, potato, and toast, and a side of pancakes.  Delish.

Oh and the carrot cake with the maple cream cheese icing was also VERY delicious."
438,"BYO mexican spot in Northern Liberties

Came for brunch and the service was great. Food was delicious. I'm a fan of chorizo and they highlight chorizo a lot in their dishes.

Bring some tequila and order some margarita mix."
439,"Branched out passed manayunk and roxborough to East Falls for some pizza.  Got the family special of large pizza, buffalo chicken cheesesteak and wings with a 2 liter.
The pizza itself was better than average.  There was a good amount of cheese on the pie.  The sauce was tasty and well seasoned.  It seemed like it had a hint of anchovies in the sauce.  Either that or garlic.  The wings were excellent top notch.  Very hot even though it was take out which was hard to do.  With several flavors to choose from we got the naked honey BBQ.  Thy were meaty and massive.  I def would return for the wings.  A good sign upon walking in were the empty boxes of liscios rolls outside.  The roll of course was fresh and soft while the chicken was chopped breast meat with a spicy hot sauce and Gorgonzola.  Good sandwhich but not overfilling."
440,"I imagine this place gets super busy during the week, but I stopped by for a weekend brunch and had no issues getting in. Delicious food, pretty space. I'll be back."
441,"Decor was  beautiful, food was absolutely spectacular. My server Lynn was a bit condescending and mispronounced a majority of the names of the dishes. I don't particularly like being treated like a child, but despite this I would happily come back to enjoy the food and atmosphere!"
442,"When I first  heard a family member suggest going to this restaurant and describe it as a breakfast and a Mexican restaurant in one I was certain that it would be awful. I couldn't have been more wrong. The menu was huge and full of tons of options. Being a vegetarian I am always worried when going to a new restaurant but here you do not have to worry. They have vegetarian options that aren't normal available in authentic Mexican restaurant.  The portion size vs the price was reasonable. My aunt and I were able to take home left overs for a $8 meal, which is always a plus. 


The service was fantastic even though there was only one cook and one waiter. She was very friendly and took her time when we asked questions about the menu. We also came there with a 1.5 year old and asked for specialty item (cup of fruit) and they were more than happy to make it for us without the usual  'sorry we don't offer that and I could probably get the cook to make that for you but I don't really care enough' look."
443,"Great place for a happy hour or a group! I'll admit I'm not a big beer fan, but a lot of my friends are, and here, they have beer as well as other drinks, plus a great ambiance. They have a yummy (and cheap) Sonoran hot dog on the menu, too. Live music on some nights. And happy hour prices every time a train passes by! Clean dining area and bathrooms. Fun hangout, away from the mostly busy streets of central Tucson.

The only downside is the hit or miss service -- hey, sometimes it's super crowded, but still!"
444,"Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza is definitely one of the best pizza places in the area. When I think of eating at Anthony's, I start salivating.

They have an outdoor area with an indoor/outdoor bar separating the patio from the restaurant. 

My go-to order at Anthony's Coal Fired is a large Proscuitto and Onion pizza with the proscuitto baked (they can either top the pizza with after it's cooked or bake the proscuitto with the rest of the pizza). The saltiness of the procsuitto mixed with the fresh parmesan cheese and sautéed onions is the perfect combination. We split this between two people and always have a slice or two left over for breakfast the next day. If we only have one slice leftover, watch out.. it's a race to see who gets the last piece first!

Let's talk about the baked wings.... really, really, really good. I actually didn't get them for the first time last night and the first thing my boyfriend said to me was ""no wings?"". The wings are baked in the coal oven and have a great charcoal taste to them. They serve them with onions and focaccia bread which are equally as delicious.

Aside from the food being down right delicious, the service is always excellent for take out, dine in, or even if you're just sitting at the bar."
445,"My boyfriend and I needed a quick bite and wanted some solid pizza. We were not disappointed. This place was so good. The pizza slices are HUGE and they put so much toppings on speciality slices you will not be disappointed. Oh and the mozz sticks are perfect !!! I recommend x10 for some solid pizza etc in philly, cute little place, love the local feels."
446,"I'm pretty impressed with this place. Healthy lunch, large enough to save some for dinner. Not too expensive. Actual parking spaces. What's not to like?"
447,Let's start by saying our date night was amazing! Atmosphere was great and the staff was super friendly. Food and drinks on point and very affordable. Portion sizes are perfect. Great place to come!
448,"Food is absolutely amazing!!! The drinks were pretty high priced but if you are going just for dinner it's completely worth it. I found this place on yelp and after reading reviews, I couldn't wait to go. It was everything I expected. A must go."
449,Me and my wife and our friends went to The Pines Tavern. The food is really good there. We were going to a show at BRT so we look up a bar in Bristol Pa. That how we found this place . It like a corner Bar it's small but nice. This was two weeks ago but I had put it up on Yelp because food was really good and I would go back again. My friend Pat had steak smash potatoes and vegetables said it was good. My wife had a burger and fries and I had shrimp with chicken with mixed vegetables and Francine had crab cakes. And we ordered on side chicken egg rolls the where really good too.
450,Good choice of appetizers and entrees. You can choose the level of heat for spicy dishes. Nice quiet venue.
451,"Good chill spot to grab a drink and a bite after nearby restaurants have closed. Kind of a trendy dive bar if that makes sense.

We had a Cuban and a BLT, both of which were delicious late nite fare.

Drinks were decent but nothing write home about. Can't get 5 stars without Luxardos if cocktails and food is your thing. That said I didn't peruse their beers on tap so maybe that's more of a focus. Guess I'll have to come back.

Good friendly crowd in there on a Tuesday night."
452,"I went here for happy hour a few weeks ago, and as I was disappointed that there was no ""happy hour"" I was not disappointed in  my experience in village whiskey. The drinks were fantastic- great exotic combinations. The veggie burger was probably the best I have ever consumed. I have been here several times when I cannot even get in for a seat, so be prepared. The drinks are small and expensive but delicious, but hte food is reasonably priced. I will definitely be back!"
453,"Tried the cheesesteak, Italian hoagie and mozzarella fries. All were delicious and the price is reasonable. Nice people too-I asked for a to-go box for the rest of my hoagie and they wrapped it up for me and put it in a bag. Wasn't expecting that from a walk in pizza place. Overall, great food and great service."
454,"Iced Irish cream coffee was exactly what I needed. Free wifi, chilled place. Outdoor seating. Not freezing cold like other cafes around."
455,Food is creative and original. Wouldn't think so but the portions are very large. I would give 5 stars but the service has been inconsistent the 4 or 5 times we have been there. If you like Mexican but are tired of the same old stuff give this place a try. A bit more expensive but worth the experience.
456,"We hit this place late night for dinner when we got back late from a tour. It was right near our hotel so that helped. The raw bar selections were very good, local oysters, giant shrimp and king crab. Service was excellent as well. The burger my wife and son split was good, but nothing to write home about but I wouldn't have come here for just that. Decent bar scene as well."
457,"Finally got a chance to try this place and I'm so glad I did! I went for the elote (Mexican corn) that I heard about and was happy that it was just as tasty and delicious as any I've had before. I also tried a couple tacos, they have a great selection with all different kinds of meats. Staff was friendly and the food was inexpensive and good. Not many tables to sit at, but overall a great, quick lunch spot."
458,"I love this place. Love the Dan Dan noodles, the scallion pancake, the three cup chicken, and all the dumplings. It's delicious, the service is good, and the food is not as agonisingly spicy as some reviews say. It reminds me of all the old Szechuan places on Spadina in Toronto, except marginally better and more upscale. Good, interesting cocktails too."
459,"As hotel restaurants go, this place was very satisfying. For the 3 days that we stayed here at the Blake Hotel, we ate breakfast, came in for drinks, for coffee, and for appetizers. Pretty much everything that we ordered and tried was good. I have to give a shout out for a few things that we indulged in - one was the rum punch during happy hour, which is only $5. They have great mozzarella sticks that come with a marinara sauce and a ranch sauce for dipping. The gumbo, though not outstanding, was very good. For breakfast one morning, I got the 3 egg omelette and I chose to stuff it with andouille sausage and pepper jack cheese. It was delicious. The breakfast came with a side order of creamy grits and a biscuit."
460,"Ok so I lied. There is no falafel here. Went back and got the ziggy burger (eh), crispy chick'n sandwhich (amazing!), quinoa chili (yum), udon salad (eh), and sweet potato fries (pretty good). It's nice to have the option of a vegetarian fast food place because who knows what some of those places put in the mean."
461,"Had a great breakfast this morning. Met the manager Nick. Great guy. Loved the fact that he took time to go out of his way to talk to me and ask how my dining experience was. Great spot for the locals as well as the tourists. I had the Big Easy breakfast. Enough food for two. The pancakes were excellent. Good fast service, good food and overall good experience."
462,"Mr. B's.  Yes.  I was walking back to my car from ACME, when I spotted a fisherman who was parked and selling his fresh shrimp catch to a chef out on the street.  I took one quick look at his catch and found the most wonderful looking jumbo shrimp I had ever laid eyes on.  Not your standard jumbo, but real JUMBO.  Huge tasty looking shrimp!

I was compelled--even though I had just gorged myself on chargrilled oysters and a po'boy--to inquire about these shrimp of his.  I asked him, ""excuse me, sir, where is the absolute best place to eat those shrimp of yours around here?""

His answer: ""Mr B's, you have to try the BBQ shrimp there for sure""

Who dat?  Mr B's dat.  My convinced my coworker (which wasn't to difficult) to come with me to try the BBQ shrimp.  We quickly sat at the bar, as we had already eaten lunch, and requested an order of BBQ shrimp to share.

When the shrimp came to us, and we took that first bite (after peeling the shrimp, of course), we found ourselves in decapod heaven.  They were served swimming (no pun intended) in a delectable buttery/spicy sauce, which was truly amazing.  The smokey and spicy flavors of the sauce were infused into the shrimp, which is truly no small feat.  The best part about a sauce like this is that it seems to build in nuance and intensity with each bite.  Each shrimp, as a result, seemed better than the one just before it.

I was so amazed, that I returned the very next day for another order of BBQ shrimp, to be split with a different friend.  I take great pleasure in sharing the things I truly enjoy with friends, and what better way to do that than over a bowl of BBQ shrimp at Mr. B's?"
463,"Good prices. Great food, glad it's part of Trolley. If they stayed open late they would make a killing when the car closed... Just like college towns do !!"
464,Muriels has delicious food and fantastic service! The goat cheese and crawfish crepes are AMAZING and the seafood stew so flavorful and satisfying! Even though we were stuffed we had to have dessert. Go to Muriel's and indulge. You will be happy you did!
465,"You would think when you have a prix fixe menu it would make it easier to choose what you want to eat - at Sbraga this is definitely not the case.  It is actually quite complex and involves solid negotiating and compromising skills with your fellow table-mates to ensure that you get a bite of everything you wanted to try!

For the first course I got the Foie Gras soup.  Unless you have some animal rights hang-up about it - you should get the soup.  It's probably the best soup I've ever had.  I also tried the pork belly.  It was just okay - almost like a pork belly carpaccio (in texture and thickness).  

The second course I had the calamari.  In my head I was thinking crispy calamari - just because that's the only calamari I've ever had.  These were large calamari with an almost scallop texture to them.  The salsa verde was good, but I wasn't a huge fan of the calamari itself.  Also tried the salmon which was good - not great.  

For the third course I had the meatloaf - it was excellent.  Perfectly tender and seasoned.  I also had some of the pasta someone got - it was also very good.

For dessert I had the pistachio bread putting which was a deconstructed dessert with the ingredients all separated on the plate.  It both looked stellar and was tasty.

Surprisingly - I felt full despite the rather small portions.  All in all there were some excellent dishes (get the soup I tell you!) - but there were also a couple 'so-so' dishes.  For $100 a head (after a couple drinks per person) and small portions, I would expect a bit more consistent excellence for 5 stars."
466,"Really liked this place. 

It was a bit busy as it was a Sunday morning when we visited so I feel like our waitress was a bit overwhelmed however, the food was so good. I love the fresh and healthy options. I had avocado smashed w/olive oil and salt over toast and their fresh juice. Awesome."
467,"The secret to GIgi and Big R is NOT to order the fried chicken. The fried chicken is still a very solid choice, but nothing too special. Instead go with the jerk chicken. It's just a little bit spicy and it's oh-so-tender and juicy. 

For sides, I almost always go with the mac n' cheese and the dirty rice. The mac n' cheese is much like the fried chicken, very solid but nothing special. However, the dirty rice is amongst the best I've had, and yes, I have had Bojangles.

Also, skip the sandwich. It's just...chicken between two slices of plain white bread. Get the platter! 

Yes, you can expect to wait for your food at Gigi's, but it's worth it!"
468,"Service here was quick and friendly but it was really slow while I was there so who knows if it's always that quick. The menu caters to everyone - vegans, vegetarians, and carnivores. I don't recall any gluten free options but don't quote me on that. The atmosphere is okay but they had way more seating than I expected from the entrance. I ordered the vegan sausage sandwich and I thought it was pretty good. I would probably go back at some point."
469,"Great place to get a diner plate lunch like meatloaf, jambalaya and poboys. Real cooked food not processed foods.No fancy but good food fast."
470,"This was a very good grilled cheese.  I had the juice and it was good, had a good little bite to it with the pepper jack.  The bacon mac and cheese was also very good.  Will be back when I'm in town."
471,"Good, casual, homemade bistro fare at a very reasonable price.  Everything was made from scratch - the bacon, the mustard, etc.  The atmosphere was nice.  Just a really solid place.  If I lived in New Orleans, I'd be a regular!"
472,"Honestly this is my favorite place to get pizza but there are a few little issues that keeps me from giving it 5 stars. One is how much everything costs, it is worth it but I still feel like the only reason why I don't order there often is that sometimes the good stuff is around $30 for one pizza. My other reason is that sometimes the food will get to you undercooked and that is based on how many toppings it has since they seem to put  all the food items in the same oven for the same amount of time."
473,Really good food and a great place to take a large family. The baked fish is really good and the portions are huge. The peanut butter pie is a great desert. The waitresses are really nice and make sure you have plenty to drink. Prices are very reasonable.
474,Flavorful Thai food. Phad Thai is very good. Service is quick. The portions can be a bit inconsistent and when they are it's on the small side.
475,"Their food was excellent! I was surprised it was fairly empty. Tuscon, you are overlooking a gem!"
476,"You know the place must have good food when the average BMI of their patrons is 42. 

South Jersey has diners galore... which one to choose? WHICH ONE TO CHOOOOOSE?!?! Oh the options! Picked Meadow's Diner based on the reviews and was not disappointed. 

Came in at 10:30ish on a Saturday morning and while busy, I was still seated promptly and with a smile. Service was slightly lacking for refills on water but heeeeeey! It's JERSEY. I had the French Toast w/ Italian Sausage (which was homemade and very authentic [not to mention spicy]). The French Toast was fluffy but a bit cold. Boyfriend had some sort of artery clogging omelet which was very tasty but I'm sure it was about 5,000 calories (heeeeeeey! it's JERSEY!). 

Overall I good place to eat really fattening foods to give you the serious ITIS for about 12 hours. $50 for 5 people"
477,Great food with affordable price. Homemade feeling. Had the seafood basket and it was great.
478,"I love this place. Been coming here for almost 20 years. If you want good boiled or fried seafood in an extremely casual no frills atmosphere, this place is a safe bet. The raw oysters here are always very fresh and reasonably priced. The service is good if a bit rushed at times (the place is small and gets VERY busy). Not the place to go to impress a first date or before a night at the theatre, but perfect before enjoying a night out at Mardi Gras or after a long day of Jazzfest."
479,An easy walk from Quality Beach Resorts. We sat upstairs on the deck. The service was quick and polite. We shared calamari as an appetizer and enjoyed our drinks.
480,"My medical office had our Christmas party in 2016 at The Depot Craft Brewery Distillery.  Food was EXCELLENT.  Employees were courteous and professional.  We were in the upstairs large group gathering room, which was awesome. We had a bartender and servers all to ourselves.  Did I mention the food was EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!

Only con? Parking for us arriving at 5 pm was waaaaaaaay in the back behind the building and it was raining that night.  :("
481,"I've always loved Gray Brothers. Their food is really, really good. Especially when you need/want comfort food. My #1 favorite is the chicken and noodles - and for those who won't eat the entire (quite generous) portion - you might not know that they offer a small portion for the main course. My most recent trip I got fried shrimp (which were delicious) and a pumpkin roll that melts in your mouth. My only issue with the place is that it is SO dark and dreary in there. I recently heard they'd done a renovation and the only thing I could see that had been done was that there was a new ""country store"" that  was added to the middle of the dining area. Meh."
482,"Hands down the best gyro I have ever had.  I have liked pretty much every gyro I have ever eaten because really, what is there NOT to like? So what makes this one stand apart?

The variety of gyro toppings/meat choices/sauces isn't staggering, but definitely impressive nonetheless.  A gyro with hot sauce?  SIGN ME UP!  It was called the gyro picanti and it was the most scrumptious meat treat I can remember ever eating.  The presentation is tight and it is perfectly layered to make each bite complex.  The hot sauce plays off the tzatziki as if it was meant to be (think blue cheese and wings).  

While the gyro was inspired, the pasta salad was nothing to write home about and this is clearly a take-out place as their is nothing inviting you to stay and sit.  You have to get your own silverware and such.  

Winner, winner gyro dinner."
483,"Decent place to study, work and what have you. Awesome, friendly and smiley staff. Moderately priced cafe fare. Ample tables and outlets. Hands down one of my fav cafes in Philly."
484,"I wish there was a way to give half stars.  Bottleworks would be a 3.5 in my book, but I am going to round up, mainly in tribute to my husband's love of this place as well as appropriate weight given to the excellent beer.

I have a love hate relationship with this place.  Love is the beer, which is  stellar as expected for Schlafly and hanging out in the bar with a live band is definitely a good time (though I could do without the smoke).  The festivals are also outstanding (Prohibition!).

The major problem I have with Bottleworks is the inconsistency of the food.  Some days, it's solid and satisfying;  I love the multigrain (including quinoa)  pilaf they have available as a side.  Other days you end up with burnt dried out beer bread and poorly seasoned food.  I never know what day it's going to be, so I am wary.  I have never understood this since I have never had a bad meal at the Tap Room which I assume is run by the same group.    It seems the bad days are lessening but they still sneak in there.  This having been said, I still come here pretty regularly given my husband is a huge fan, and I always love the beer.  When in doubt, drink."
485,"We found ourselves in need of a snack after disappointing food selection at a festival we'd attended and saw great reviews of the bahn mi here.  We were not disappointed!  We did the grilled chicken bahn mi and the Brian's Special (grilled pork with egg).  Both were on wonderfully fresh bread, loaded with lightly pickled daikon and carrot (I could eat these veggies by the pound).  The filling to bread ratio was good and my dining buddies appreciated that the herbs and jalepenos came on the side.  I appreciated it too since I ended up with everyone's cilantro.  

The Child Who Eats Almost Nothing (seriously, she won't eat chicken) decided Pho sounded good.  When her tummy got full, we ended up with about half the portion.  As we were eating, we noticed some interesting ingredients in the Pho and asked her what she had told the cashier when she ordered.  She's never been one for bothering to read very closely or taking out her ear buds when ordering and apparently she requested with everything - including tripe and tendon.  When we pointed this out, she shrugged and said ""Oh, I wondered what that was.  Tasted pretty good"".  So, well done Seasons - you got someone who refuses to eat poultry and most veggies to blithely scarf down tripe and proclaim it pretty good.  No small feat!"
486,"I stopped by Veekoo on my way to the Outlets. Nice Asian fusion restaurant. The sushi was unexpectedly good and is made fresh to order. The sushi bar is separate from the regular dining area. The menu is a mix of Chinese and Thai, in addition to the Japanese. The soft shell crabs were delicious considering they're not really in season. Service was excellent! In this neck of the woods I wouldn't expect to find a better Asian fusion restaurant."
487,Peter piper on roids. Good pizza
488,"We discovered Beck's cafe at the Reading Terminal Market last weekend. Boy am I glad we did. My wife's family is from Louisiana and Mississippi, and have a long history of cooking cajun cuisine. We had the muffaletta sandwich and shrimp/crawfish etouffee. The etouffee was amazing and as good as what my father-in-law makes. The chef was knowledgeable about the holy trinity (celery, bell pepper, onion) and gave us a good tip on where to buy gumbo file powder. The bread pudding with pears and raisins was the best I've had since visiting New Orleans. We will have to go back for there breakfast beignets. They also have alligator on a stick!"
489,"My one sentence take: It's not the most delicious food you've ever had, but it may be the most interesting.

The only real options are a $45 four-course meal or a $65 chef tasting meal. While the four-course meal may not seem like much and the portions look small, the dishes are really rich. I have a big appetite and was actually pretty full at the end of everything. I would also say that the desserts are the only more traditional part of the menu, and they were excellent.

Sbraga serves some really interesting combinations of flavors, many of which I'd never even comprehended. Oysters with apple, jalepeno, and caviar; lamb chop with lamb belly and oatmeal; quail with sweetbreads; scallop and pork belly with watermelon and jalepeno; etc. There were no bad dishes that we tried, and I won't really recommend favorites (check that, the miso black cod was our semi-unanimous choice for best dish). What you order should mostly depend on your tastes and how adventurous you're feeling that night.

One disappointment was that the Singapore Sling was taken off the menu. I was really looking forward to trying it. Oh well."
490,"Be prepared to wait if you come here. We were given a 40min wait on a saturday night. But walking around 12 south was always pleasant so I didnt mind that. Also they use an app that shows you in real time how much waiting time you have left and how many people before you in the line. Cool, huh?

Food - tasty burgers and even tastier fries!!! We ended up ordering 2 extra portions of fries for takeout after our meal and munched on those during our House of Cards binging session later that day. So worth it!"
491,"Another Nashville-area secret--just south of the city in Grassland. Oh my! Have had lunch here several times. Always great food served with courtesy. Stopped this morning for the Sunday Brunch. Oh my! Sweet, savory, succulent, satisfying and a bargain to boot! Too many dishes to mention, so let me highlight just a few: Eggs Benedict served on split Croissant instead of English Muffin - so flavorful, rich & creamy, eggs done perfectly. Jalapeño Grits - not hot - just piquant enough and so very, very sweet and buttery...mmm. Broccoli salad (and other salads) plus grilled veggies - just right. Steamed shrimp cooked just right. Coconut-crusted Goat cheese medallions - decadently melt in your mouth. Roast beef with wild-mushroom gravy...the beef was tender and bright, pink rare--beautiful. (The mushroom gravy just so-so.) Baked ham. Desserts that I didn't have room to try. And, did I mention...made-to-order omelets and waffles. The list goes on. Oh my. Oh my!"
492,"Great service, oysters, crab cake sandwich, crab she chowder and drinks! You should come here!!"
493,"Been here many times now since moving to Apollo Beach. The pizza is very solid and consistent. I especially like the crust as you can take one look and know that it is hand tossed and not ""machine-made"" as some places do. 

I have not tried anything else on their menu. What can I say ... I'm a pizza guy!  Oh ... And they always honor their coupons when you check in."
494,"i must agree with the reviews.  Hemingway's offers a delightful dining experience. restaurant ambiance is right.  just enough of design, comfort noise level and  service. as mentioned,  the Duck Poutine is fantastic ! we shared the tasty Short Rib Stew,  the excellent Korean Chicken (nashville style), , scratch southern Chicken n Dumplings,  Trumpet Mushroom vegetable combo presented a most, delicious , enjoyable dinner. AND   spectacular cocktails...............  !!!!!!!"
495,Place is great!! Tacos and burritos and plenty of choices! They have different flavor sauces as well that you can try. All different tastes from mild to hot and also some sweet. It's a great place in Westchase. For sure try it!!
496,"A hot spot of a little gem! Plenty is whiskey and creative drinks flowing.. Always an interesting crowd, the charm of the Burg! 
By the way, the good us amazing and great happy hour specials:::"
497,Wife and I got the eggs Benedict. I am an eggs Benedict lover (I'll Admit it) whoever first decided to put together poached eggs English muffins Canadian bacon and a creamy leaning sauce called Hollandaise is a genius. This eggs Benedict didn't disappoint. The English muffins was crunchy but not over toasted the eggs were poached perfect the Canadian bacon was done solidly and the Hollandaise a homerun. We also both got grits -- I thought they were great the ride thought a shade bland. I'll go with her assessment as she is from the South and so am a transplant. It is a bit pricey $42 for two but we were staying at the Royal Sonesta so it was convenient.
498,"Headed to Franklin TN for the day from our weekend in Nashville.  Read about this location on yelp and looking for a good hearty breakfast....great choice.  Busy busy place but, still the service was attentive and friendly.  Neat concept of a location....looks like a restaurant....or bar with stage....or a grocery store.  It's really cool!   Food was so flavorful, hot and just all over great.  Good portions and great options....menu items and a breakfast buffet....can't go wrong.

Defintely, would recommend!!"
499,"The food is quite good (and at a lower price than other, similar popular brunch spots in philly). The stuffed french toast, smoothies, and fries were all delicious. The wait is usually a bit long b/c seating is very limited."
500,Not a bad place to try out some authentic Taiwanese cuisine. Service could be better and parking situation also needs improvement!
501,"Excellent food! We had such a complicated order for hibachi, and they were so gracious. We had four tofu and vegetable, one vegan, and one chicken hibachi. For the rice, we had one without butter or eggs, four with butter but no eggs, and one with eggs and butter. As you can see, we were totally annoying. But our server and chef were so accommodating.  Our chef, Tanaka, was great...and the tofu was AMAZING. We also had miso soup, noodles, vegetables, and fried rice. Everything was great except the vegetables, which were pretty bland. We also got a side of mushrooms, which was a waste...not flavorful at all. Portions were big. Service was great!"
502,"I've lived  a few blocks from this place for nearly three years now, and I thank Yelp for letting me know what I'm missing out on.  I went in for lunch earlier this week to try out the vegetarian hoagie... i had the veg special. It was delicious. The roll very crispy and fresh, the flavors very strong- jalepeno, cilantro, sauteed veggies, tofu, and some sort of yellow mayo that I always think is a dessert (mango pudding?) when I see it in the case.  Anyway the sandwich is delicious, and although prices are now $4 for a sandwich (up from $1.50) its still a steal for a quick lunch.  I also tried the rice and mung beans with coconut milk for dessert- delicious, an excellent way to add a little protein to a yummy dessert. Next time you're in the neighborhood I'd recommend stopping in to support this local business."
503,"Eight of us came here for brunch for my birthday. We made a reservation and were seated quickly. We did the all-inclusive bottomless drinks which came with the order of any entree. The Bloody Mary's were excellent but the mimosas were more OJ than champagne. I had the steak and eggs which were amazing! The rest of the table enjoyed their food as well. 

Our server, Cesar, was excellent. 5 stars for him but 4 stars for the overall experience. We will be back for lunch or dinner another time to try it out!"
504,"This bakery / pastry shop is located in the Reading market. I stopped by for breakfast and purchased 2 items, Carrot cake and Tiramisu. Match this with a cafe from Old City coffee and you are in for a treat these two left me full and ready for the day. Thankfully it's was a very active day and it helped me avoid the sugar crash. This was also because these items were not over sweet and rich in flavour. I can not enjoy something that is too sweet and lacking in flavour. I will return to try the lemonciello pecan diamonds and pasticcios. 
Check this place out in the Reading market you'll like it."
505,"The food was yummilicious!   The fries could have had alittle more shredded duck,  but the overall flavor was spot on.  Duck Fat! 
The Tso  wings writer the wasabi blue cheese dipping sauce was wonderful... not too spicy which was  perfect for me. 
One complaint... . our waiter was packing our food and instead of using a utensil he used his fingers.... I was not happy about this... and will pack my own food moving forward. 
So that means I'm going back!"
506,Ive eaten here 3 of the last 5 days!! Food is great and the people are really nice! Ive only had the vermicelli bowl so far but i overheard the couple next to me really enjoying their phó.
507,"The food here is greatbut kinda expensive. The curry noodle is kinda salty, but I recommend the vege fried rice, it is really good. The place is kinda small so if you decide to go better call for reservation."
508,"Cafe primo is one of my new favorite places in Santa Barbara. My partner and I eat their for happy hour at least twice a week. The elixirs (juice/kombucha type thing) are amazing! 32 ounces for 6 bucks! 

The calamari is our favorite thing. We order it all the time. To be fair we usually only order from the seafood appetizer menu, but the calamari is nice. Also the tuna tar tar and ceviche are delicious. 

The main menu is so-so in my opinion but the place is beautiful with floor to ceiling plan glass windows, a beautiful bar, stunning floor and great decor over-all. 

It's a great place to people watch and have beer and wine. Plus they have wifi!"
509,"The food was excellent, no complaints at all there. I was very happy with the hostesses as well. The waitstaff was okay for the most part. I would have been more happy if they stopped by a bit more than they did.

Certainly a must visit when in the city."
510,"Sabrinas in collingswood is def greatly welcomed. Oh and if you didn't know, on a crazy busy weekend you can put your name in the wait list via yelp. It saved me atleast 30 min today when the usual wait time was close to an hour. Food is awesome like expected. Ive been to this one multiple times now. The stuffed French toast challah bread are amazing and are genermous. Huevos rancheros are amazing and I think the best ones in Philly area, the minty sauce on the top is just the best thing ever. Tofu scramble is also very good. In short pretty much everything is very decent. The servers are super friendly here. In summers they also have a back patio area which I've never seen open. In short , if I'm not planning to cross the bridge, pay toll, find parking or wanna deal with Philly traffic or get on patco to get to Philly then Sabrinas is my go to place for brunch and has never disappointed me."
511,"We ate here last night during the 6:00 pm rush. We shared an order of fried pickles and I had the pork tacos. The fried pickles were decent and the tacos were excellent! Good flavor and great texture. I'll definitely be having those again! Don't bother deciding on your sides until you get up to the counter and can see the board because they do not have everything on the menu every day. The mac and cheese was so good! It wasn't what I expected from a BBQ place! The ""baked beans"" we're also good but they are really mixed beans and not at all like the BBQ baked beans you get at other places. Still good, just not baked. 
They also had Abita Strawberry and the Blackforest Kolsch. Excellent bar selection!!
I'm docking them a star because of the system of ordering at the counter and then taking the plastic number to a table. This system works in theory, and in practice at other places, but you HAVE to keep people from ""saving tables"" when they have yet to order. I get it if you have a group of 10 but for normal sized tables, it throws the whole system off! The line was long last night but the food comes out fast so tables turn over quickly. By the time we ordered there were no open tables. There were around 8 tables taken up by people who were still 20 minutes from ordering. That throws the whole system off! Let people who have already ordered eat. Another table will open up for you by the time you order!
This can easily be solved by posting a sign and asking the servers to enforce it. 
Luckily there were two spots open at the bar. 
On a side note, the bartender was awesome: fast, attentive, and knowledgeable. I may just sit there in the first place next time!"
512,Great seafood - Love the fried shrimp. My husband got the stuff I tried it but didn't like it so much. He's had the stuffed Mirliton
513,"Great prices, especially being locally owned. It's obviously not going to be cheaper than, say, Walmart, for most items... but it's a muuuuuch better alternative. The employees are unusually helpful and friendly. They have a huge selection of everything. The produce is fresh. They have the usual cuts of meat, plus a section of freshly made options like stuffed pork loin, stuffed chicken, cajun burgers, blue cheese burgers, stuffed mushrooms, stuffed peppers, etc. 

I also feel that I should mention the alcohol selection, because I don't think anyone has brought that up in a review yet (kidding). So good... and cheap!!!

The bakery is amazing, as is the deli. As soon as you walk in, you can smell the fresh-baked goods. Oh, and in addition to their regular King Cakes during carnival season, they have sugar free for those diabetics out there. It's actually pretty darn good, too, but a bit on the pricey side compared to their usual competitive prices. However, this is a novelty IMO, so I'll let that slide.

The only downside for me is the narrow aisles and the parking lot where I feel like I'm going to get rear-ended, side-swiped, or possibly both at the same time by the old people in LARGE cars trying to fight over parking spaces. Do yourself a favor and park on an adjacent street, or in one of the side parking spaces if at all possible.

They need to open a location on the Westbank... just because it would be more convenient for me (no, I didn't deduct stars for this - just a suggestion)."
514,This is such a great place for yummy sushi. And it's fun for kids. The prices are very reasonable. And there's a cool table for a large group that you can sit in without shoes.
515,"We love AJ's! The specialty food selections are outstanding. We love to get a light dinner and eat on the patio. Tonight we enjoyed soup and salads. The service experience at the deli counter is sort of hit and miss. Tonight they were understaffed.  We will be back. 

First of all, the service at the deli was much improved since our last visit!  Tonight was another fun dinner on the patio! We enjoyed the fountain while enjoying our meal of turkey chili and the NY steak dinner. We will be back!"
516,I love that they deliver and the food is pretty good. There is a variety of choices and all reasonably priced. Service is great too!
517,"Romantic and cozy French restaurant. A bit pricey, but you get your money's worth with the nice portions. The escargot is highly recommended. Try and save room for dessert."
518,"i just love a good burger!
its done right if its cooked to the perfect medium I ordered.  patty was thick and juicy. fat was dripping out.  thousand island sauce adds to the extra fattiness. bun was lightly toasted and oily.  everything was fatty!

tator tots was soft and crunchy and, again, greasy.

a little on the greasy side for me....but for others, thats what it is all about.
ive had burgers multiple times this week, and within the week, the village burger was the best of the ones i had"
519,"It's a relatively small space, there are maybe only 7 tables inside. They have vegetarian options! I tried the spicy Sichuan chili fat noodles and it was not that spicy for me (they said it was the spiciest item on their menu but it's not too spicy). It was good, but slightly bland. My friend got the other dish I don't remember the name of (refer to photo), but it was really good. My food would get 3 stars (quite average) but friend's bowl was better, and the service was prompt and wonderful."
520,"It is a good experience, so give it a try.

When you walk in you can tell it is slightly more upscale than its surroundings.  It's near the bourbon street area, and most of that are bars and entertainment.

Mr. B's is that white table cloth kind of place and the servers all look like they are in suits.  The atmosphere is nice, and fairly casual.

The food is pretty good.  They have a pork and fig entree...the pork was very tender, but there wasn't enough of the fig to really make a difference.  There is also a pork chop entree that is really good, but not as tender as the pork and fig.

The bbq shrimp was really good....they give you a bib so you don't splatter on yourself.  

They had a fish special of the night which was a drum....never heard of that kind of fish, but it was also really good.

Overall,  good place.  I recommend trying it"
521,"One of my favorite spots to swing by while in the Ybor area, either with a group of friends or alone, as they do have a lot of space to bring out your laptop to work or read.

Since I usually come during the workday for lunch, I'm a big fan of their specialty coffee drinks. They have a very unique one - espresso lemonade - which I got to try on my last visit. The bitterness was cancelled out by the lemonade and it was delicious.

The Bricks has a good choice of apps/salads/sandwiches and I also tried a spicy chorizo, creamed soup, which my server recommended, and he was right-on point with this pick.

If you're in Ybor please make sure you stop by here...it's vegan/vegetarian friendly and just has a good all-around vibe inside."
522,"When I first walked into this restaurant I almost walked back out!  There was no one in there, and it is tiny and not to fancy. The only reason I went here is because it is across the street from where I live.  I'm so glad I stayed!!  Everything was really fresh, and really good.  I always get seaweed salad when I go to sushi, and it was pretty good here.  The spicy tuna was great! Overal I was impressed, its still not my fav in Nashville, but its up there."
523,"Large menu selection with reasonably good Vietnamese dishes. They serve the only ""real"" bánh mì in town. However, the Vietnamese coffee should be prepared with condensed milk as advertised on the menu but unfortunately it is not. Friendly and relaxed atmosphere. Good service!"
524,"I like what this place does, the food is good, the service was excellent, and its a sort of twist on greek food. Owner was very nice and helpful, kinda tucked away off nolensville but easy to find. I recommend the falafel, and hummus."
525,"Step out of your comfort zone and try this restaurant,  you won't be disappointed.  I drive by this location often while on the road for work and decided to make a go for it today.  I was dining alone so it can be a little uncomfortable walking into the unknown.  The staff was very friendly,  answered all of my questions and had my food ready quickly. I was greeted with a nice warm basket of pita and pickles (pickled veggies).  I ordered Foule from the appetizer menu which consists of whole chick peas, spices, lemon juice and some of the best olive oil I have ever had the pleasure of tasting.  It was so rich in flavor and color. I enjoyed it with the warm pita.  Next was my chicken kabob ""sandwich"" which was nice hearty chunks of grilled chicken, green and red peppers rolled into another large pita. It's alot of food so more than likely you will be asking for a to go box. The atmosphere was nice and clean and I can not wait to try more menu items."
526,The fried chicken is really good here. I know that sounds weird that a donut place has fried chicken but not to people that live in philly and know about federal donuts. The location in NoLibs is on a sketchy street with nothing else around it. The donuts are really good too but the fried chicken is the star here.
527,"Stumbled in here after a kayaking trip around 6 pm on a Saturday and it was eerily quiet but I was starving.  Boyfriend and I shared some pulled pork nachos and they were bangin'!  We had a side of brussel sprouts which were cold (purposefully) but delicious.

Then, since we had a long ride home we gobbled up some other goodies.  White cherries (in season, but tough to find), cupcakes, some random candies and such.  Everything I had was delicious.  We grabbed a half dozen apple cider donuts which usually you only find around pumpkin patches in the fall.  They didn't even make the car ride home - gone!  

If you only come here for one reason, come for the donuts!  Gorgeous. 

Overall, the place was adorable with deli-like counters for baked goods and country-style eats  made to order but had some grab n go stuff too.  Quaint little cafe tables inside and out to sit in a barn/warehouse-like atmosphere.  I liked the rocking chairs on the porch - nice touch!  

If I am kayaking again on the Brandywine, I'll surely be visiting again."
528,"Yep, that cinnamon bread is a winner.  I'll order it as my brunch entree next time around.  The mimosa with lavender was also darn tasty!  The frittata I ordered was lacking (not very large, sunken, and way too hot for most of the meal) but my hubby's bacon and fried egg on pretzel bun with bacon jam was to die for.  They sell their bacon jam and, my goodness, how I'd recommend it!"
529,"Well, I can't lie, they were definitely good--I got the Bacon & Eggs (3 pancakes, bacon, and 3 eggs) which were great. My bf got the Caribbean Pancakes (pancakes w/ bananas, walnuts, coconut shavings, and powered sugar) & side of Grits. The grits were my FAVORITE--all super buttery--and I don't even like grits! While everything was good, and I would surely go back and try other things, I think a lot of it is hype, it's good, but people make it sound glorious and orgasmic. I've had better pancakes that just melted in my mouth (literally) elsewhere. But for the overall experience, I'd say it's good, but it's not the hype people make it to be, but I'd def go back

P.S. We saw Reese Witherspoon there"
530,This place is very crowded.  The prices are reasonable.  We had two omelets and two coffees.  The food was good but not great.  The eggs were overcooked and the cheese very light so nothing to cover up the overcooked eggs.  Coffee was fine for an all you drink setup.    Four stars because the service was quick and friendly.
531,"Cheapest city-wides this side of the Schuylkill. Do you need another reason to stop by this place on a Friday night? Everyone here is very friendly and welcoming. I wish their menu had more to offer, but the fries are steak fries and are also DELICIOUS."
532,"We stumbled upon Three Muses during our first few hours exploring Frenchmen Street. We put our names in for a table and had a long wait. But who cares! There's plenty to entertain you in the area while you wait. 

A late dinner at Three Muses was the perfect way to start our weekend in New Orleans: great food, local beers, wonderful live music, and friendly service. My group of four shared a bunch of tapas including: seared scallops, bacon wrapped dates, lamb sliders, swiss chard fritters (AMAZING), mac n' cheese, and feta fries. Almost everything we tried was great and we stayed for hours, listening to the music and ordering more tapas as the night went on. Definitely a gem on Frenchmen!"
533,"First pizza place I tried after moving to STL in May.  We waited for 30 minutes for a table, but it is worth it. 

We tried the SF -style crust(corn meal and thick style) and then the STL which is the thin crust.  I didn't care for, and never really like the thin crust at any pizza joint.  The toppings are amazing and the atmospere is great.  Hopping place!

Sit outside and people watch is the way to go here.

PBR on tap and no AB products--don't ask."
534,This place is a hidden gem.  The food here is a bit trendy but very well prepared.  The drink menu has original drinks from their bar.  I found the atmosphere very relaxing.  I would highly recommend you check this place out.  It's not cheap but I  found my meal worth the money and I am looking forward to returning for another. meal.
535,Good deal if you get the large order for like 35 dollars. Definitely worth splitting among your friends
536,"We would frequent the 37th and Market Street location in Philadelphia.  We  their food!  During our last visit, I felt compelled to report to a Manager some less than hygienic habits of the chef (visible to the patrons).  Upon scheduling to visit not long after, I noticed they earned an F rating.  We were all so disappointed because we loved this place but refuse to eat in any Philadelphia eatery that rates less than a B

I pray they cleaned up their act because that pickled flounder soup is calling my name!"
537,"We came to the District Tavern for a quick bite before a concert at the Amalie. We sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and helpful. 
It was around 6 pm, so we reached for the happy hour menu (4-7 pm M-F).  Both my friend and I got the Tavern Jalapeño Margarita. I think this is my new favorite drink! Slightly spicy with charred lemon and unique deep flavor. Most importantly- not sweet! Perfection!
We shared the sandwich shooters. They are the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. I had higher expectations. The tomato bisque was kinda bland, and the baguettes were not anything to write home about. For my main entree i had the Southwest bowl- delicious! Great flavors, generous portion and nice presentation. My friend got the district salad with salmon and she was very happy with her choice too. I'd definitely come back again for the jalapeño margarita and to try something else on the menu. 
Tip-you can take the Downtowner to and from here!"
538,"This in my go to sushi place in center city. The food is always fresh and tastes good. My go to is the Kano crunch house special roll. It comes covered in spicy mayo and crunchy caviar on top. I recently discovered the ak-47 roll which comes with shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado, and a special soy paper on the outside. It's very good as well. For appetizer I love the rock shrimp which is covered in a sauce similar to spicy mayo and drizzled in soy sauce, it is crunchy and amazing. The California roll I would say is pretty standard compared to other places. They also offer a lunch special on weekdays!"
539,"Quality sushi and such great eclectic decor make for a very nice dinner experience.  Beatles music plays constantly, and between the modern oriental wall decor are pictures of John Lennon everywhere.  My date and I ordered the Love Boat for two.  There was enough sushi and sashimi to stuff us both to the gills.  The miso soup is very flavorful; a far cry from many bland misos I have had.  I would recommend with the warning that it is pricy compared to other sushi restaurants."
540,"Some people don't like the kitsch of a Mongolian BBQ, but I do.  I love being able to mix up my own meal and my own sauces and have someone else cook it.  


Mongolian of Eagle is great.  Located in a strip mall.  It is the cleanest, brightest lit Mongolian BBQ restaurant I have been in.  There is a wide selection of items to include in your meal.  Beef, chicken, and pork.  No lamb.  Service is friendly and quick.  

Judging by the high schoolers in at lunch break, it is a very popular place.

If you are in the area and interested in a quick, casual meal, this is the place to try."
541,"Overall good food and an enjoyable dinner.  One of the few places I've come across that allows you to get fried rice along with lomein in their combo dinners.  Wonton soup and spring roll were just ok, but shrimp lomein, fried rice and general tso's chicken were all tasty."
542,"Jaki C promised me Mrs K would like the place.  So  the Mrs,  Chip K his Mrs K. and myself went to Izakaya.  Jacki warned about the kinks and yes they have them.  They only had one fry cook and he/she was overwhelmed to say the least.  The place was not crowded but with the variety on the menu would be daunting for one person.  We managed to spend $91.  Don't know how things that cost $2 to $7 works out to that much but it did.  I had a California roll, chicken on a stick one with sauce and one with salt and pepper also had a beef stick and pork belly with asparagus wow was that good.  With a chaser of calamari.  Sounds like a lot of food but the meat on a stick is one bite per person.   My best dish of the night was the beef on a stick.  Tender moist with a slight chewiness that was perfect.  It was fantastic.  Wife had the shrimp tempura and it looked great and she said it was good.  So super slow food coming out of the kitchen knocked the review down one   Really can't wait to go again."
543,"What makes Barrio stand out to me is the large open space and the shuffleboard (its my favorite bar game!). This is also a good location to watch the games - lots of TVs, good beer and great happy hour prices."
544,"The atmosphere is very calm and clean. The waitstaff is attentive and the sushi is quite good.

The ""chef's specials"" rolls are creative and delivered with artistic flair. 

There was a little chaos as the orders were delivered since basically everything arrived at once (even the things called appetizers) and there were no extra plates offered so you had to kind of just eat over your little soy sauce tray. 

The only rub is that we wanted to order bento boxes for our kids and substitute the Shrimp Tempura for the Shrimp Teryaki and the waiter returned to say that this was not possible. Ok, fine. So we ordered Shrimp Tempura entrees instead. It was kind of a silly thing since the kids like the bento boxes but obviously isn't going to be a factor for most people. 

It's BYOB so bring your own beer or wine and they'll gladly bring you glasses to drink it."
545,"I like the ambiance a lot, and for the most part the food is really good. HUGE fan of the whipped feta- most important thing to order!!"
546,"Was recommended by a friend to try out this place when visitng santa barbara. The wait was worth it. Everything they had was live. Price is pretty decent for the uni. 

Got the clam chowder. Uni with svallop and bisq bowl. The uni was super fresh and not fishy.I would definitely come back and try other food they have when im back in santa barbara."
547,"Refreshingly delicious compared to crappy chain food pizza!!

I worked at the Hotel duPont... I always thought they should have given us some sort of discount for all the times we ordered from there.  While it's a very good product (don't get a ""chopped"" antipasto salad!), it's a little on the expensive side for pizza."
548,"I love to bring Nick's virgins here.  I twist their arm to order a roast beef combo and gravy fries.  It arrives nice and quick and then I just sit back and watch and listen.  It starts with the rolling of the eyes and the huge smiles with roast beef sticking out of their mouth.  Then there is the OMG, OMG, sometimes muttered several times.  It's hard to understand them because their mouth is full.  

This is all before they try the gravy fries.  Then it really gets crazy.  You know they like it when they start comparing it to sex.

Add a cheap beer in an ice cold glass and it doesn't get any better than this!"
549,"Had the pulled pork and the fried chicken for lunch on Sunday. Each came with two sides; I got the collard greens and smashed sweet potatoes with the pulled pork and my boyfriend got the fried chicken with green beans and smashed sweet potatoes. The pulled pork, fried chicken, sweet potatoes were great. I can live without the other two sides. Each plate was $9.99 which is not bad for lunch in downtown Franklin. Be warned, it's not a good place for big groups because it's pretty small and the wait for 6 was about 45 mins around 12:45pm. If I had to wait, I wouldn't have."
550,Restaurant has a quaint homely feeling.  Good as an intimate setting and the bread was so yummy. Never tried Afghani food before but now I know I like it and want more. Cheap kebobs for Rittenhouse Square area and attentive service. Waiter checked up on us multiple time while still respecting our need for privacy.
551,"I'm not sure why I haven't written a review for Pi before now because we have been there a few times.  This time we took my sister-n-law and her boyfriend who had been visiting us from England.  I shared a deep dish and my wife and her sister shared a thin crust.  All of us really enjoyed the pizzas of our choosing.  That is a great thing about Pi.  You can pick whatever style you want and also pick any pizza on their menu for your half. It makes sharing so easy!  
We were able to enjoy our pizzas outside on the sidewalk which made it even better.  The only problem was our waiter.  Not that he was a bad waiter, he just seemed to be trying to hard to be some type of character.  He also kept telling us how busy he was when he clearly was not.  
To me, Pi is St Louis' hometown pizza place.  (Not an Imo's fan! Provel???)"
552,"Chicken Marsalis, fajitas,smoked salmon were what I enjoyed today along with my Mimosas  of course. Only thing that made me leave off a star was that the crab legs were tasteless and no butter was available to give them some flavor and my mimosas  were a little slow coming but that could just be me."
553,"A bit loud, and hardly a value, but it's a great place to go and have some messed up woman rip your heart to shreds while still enjoying the food."
554,"Service in bar can be slow on the weekends so if you are in a rush, ask to sit in the dining room.  Everything gluten free is AMAZING!!! (Especially the BBQ chicken pizza).  The salads are also awesome!"
555,"The good is that these were seriously good burgers--the meat was fresh and the buns were soft and tasty

The only issues were that I called the order in and it took more than 30 minutes for it to be done--when I got it home, the bacon cheeseburger that I ordered ""plain"" as ""only meat, bread and cheese--no condiments or veggies"" had the mustard spread in the bread.

So next time I will give them more time to cook and double check the order before I leave--it was really good other than that."
556,Really love the atmosphere here.  It is perfect for lunch but rather pricey for dinner.  I'm actually more of a fan of the lunch fare anyway so it works for me.  They do have a rewards card so be sure to get started on one of those so you can build up points.  They also have a nice patio in the back for warm weather days.  Friendly staff too!
557,"This is for a to-go order. If you want to learn about the ambience of this place go read another review. We got a large pepperoni pizza late Saturday night. They deserve a solid star just for being open past 10. So many pizza places in the area close by 10 on the weekend! Sad! The pizza was on point. I loved the crust and they actually put sauce on this pizza. Feels like every other pizza I eat is all cheese and bread. Had I only ordered that would have garnered five stars for his place. 

We also ordered 10 buffalo chicken wings and they were awful. The sauce was all at the bottom and the chicken was more soggy than crispy. I love chicken wings. Down south I'm a bit of a expert (always order all flats and get them wet). These were really bad. I would definitely come here again and just order the pizza."
558,"Actually make a great cheeseburger for lunch, even though it is traditionally Greek."
559,"love vegan food.
shared a ziggy burger with a friend. presentation was cute...wrapped in brown parchment paper like a baseball.
tempah patty was delicious-warm and crispy.  texture was nice and meat like.
sauce on burger added to its juiciness and richness.  

it was a very filling burger, although i only had half of it. 
i can totally eat here daily!"
560,"This is Seriously Thai..!! I can't believe I can get a good, authentic Yen-ta-fo soup in Midwest. It's one of my favorite noodle soup in pink color due to fermented soy; served with fish balls, tofu and crab. In LA, it would also contain on-choy,  blood cake and dried shrimp.
I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try authentic Thai dishes; not your regular Americanized Thai menu."
561,"I was excited to learn that an Indian restaurant which delivers had opened in the area, and Nirvana Fusion did not disappoint. I was extremely pleased with the variety of options on the menu, the service, and the quality of food. Our order arrived promptly and everything was warm, fresh and absolutely delicious. The butter chicken and naan were particular favorites. We're looking forward to ordering again soon and trying some of the other dishes."
562,"This review should actually be three and a half stars. Cafeteria-type vibe, very no frills, with healthy offerings. I got a glass of fresh squeezed juice and the stuffed avocado salad and paid about $15 including tax and a small tip. I'm sure there are more innovative options (menu and flavor wise) for comparable prices nearby. That being said, the food is basic, good, and yes, affordable. The descriptions on yelp were accurate - I had some food left over for another meal."
563,"14 layer eggplant was light and tasty. Pure eggplant with tomato sauce and a little bit of cheese. Highly recommended. Their lasagna is supposed to be one of their famous dishes as well, but it is on the heartier side. 

Atmosphere is nice. We sat on a chilly night in the room with a fireplace. It was cozy. Also, great location right on the Delaware River. It seems like a more middle aged clientele, it's not really a hot, new restaurant. More of a conservative, nice, laid back place. Myself and my friend were the only people under 45 I'm guessing."
564,"An upscale mexican joint? Really?! I enjoy good authentic mexican food, this is by far the most upscale Ive seen.  Im more of the food trucks and hole in the walls type, so this was different than what Im used to. 

The atmosphere at Besito is tough to beat. They have Merengue & Salsa on the background which doesn't really go with the Mexican theme but who's paying attention. An ideal Date night atmosphere for sure. 

Food was very good but I must say a bit on the pricey side, you have to consider the fact that you are paying for more than a meal... You have the valet outside, truly great service, our waiter was friendly and happy to discuss the menu, he more than met our expectations. 

Guess if you and your date love Mexican food, and feel like taking it to another level for once, Besito is your place. It's a gourmet mexican restaurant, certainly worth trying."
565,"Always good, very consistent. We eat here almost weekly and have never had a negative experiance. It is in a small strip center with a very basic interior. The food is the main attraction and it is worth the trip."
566,"We were in the neighbourhood for an earlier evening event. I remembered how much I enjoyed this place in the past. So I suggested we walk over for supper. 

I still like this restaurant. Friendly service, large portions and speed of food service is consistent from when I was here a few years ago. We all enjoyed our meals and didn't feel rushed to leave our table.

However the years seem to have caught up to the place. Floor is noticeably worn down where the chairs are sliding back and forth at the tables. Bathroom was tidy but nothing exceptional by any means. Definitely want to watch that slightly raised floor going out of the bathrooms or that could be a tripping hazard. Everything is decently clean within the restaurant but this would only be a casual lunch place for me in the future."
567,"There is real quality  there. The caveat, they use a lot of canola oil which no 1st  class bakery would. But on the other hand they will make with real butter and do if you call ahead and those products are very fine."
568,"Food is great, drinks are great, deals are great (Brunch with 2-4-1 drinks? Heck yeah!). The menu is extensive and interesting, with unique twists on classic dishes. The service is also great, but I am withholding a fifth star due to the management's seating policies.

We came for brunch on a Sunday expecting an hour plus wait, so when the hostess informed us it would be 1hr45m we weren't surprised. However, we became frustrated when we noticed there were 4 open tables on the patio that still hadn't been seated after an hour of waiting. It was a beautiful day so we asked the hostess about it and she said that the tables were reserved. When we asked again, she explained that the patio tables were not assigned to a specific server but were instead added on to a server's load inside, so they weren't seating them because they didn't want to overwhelm the servers. Totally understandable to not want to overwork your servers, but why not seat people with the caveat that service will be slower? Or better yet, why not specifically assign a server to the outdoor section so that wait times will be lower? Having worked in the service industry, our group was confused by this. We ended up just sitting at one of the empty patio tables until the hostess notified us that a table was ready. 

We ordered the Cheddar Biscuit, the Wood Fire Double Yokes, and a Turkey Feta Omelette from the specials board and all were delicious. The biscuit comes in a trio and though it doesn't look like a lot of food they are VERY filling. Our server surprised us with a side of White Trash Hash on the house because our food was taking longer than expected (we didn't even notice the timing, so it was a very nice gesture). The White Trash Hash is a must, this stuff is addicting! Potatoes, rice, and gooey cheese- who could ask for more.

Overall, great place for brunch in Nashville. Expect a long line but food worth the wait. Hopefully management can improve their seating policies to cut down on wait times in the future."
569,"This was a fun place to visit for a light dinner and some great entertainment with the kiddies! We caught a band called Washboard Rodeo, and they played some fun bluegrassy-type western swing. We'd made a 7:30 reservation via Open Table and were seated immediately. It's a small place, so any table you get is a good one. This is one of the few places on Frenchman Street that seems okay for children: mine are 9 and 11 and very capable of behaving well in a gastropub setting. The menu has a great baked mac & cheese and the waitresses are warm and welcoming. I have to say, after sampling the fish tacos, I sorta wish that I had ordered the mac & cheese, too! The tacos were okay but small and pretty bland. The mac & cheese was plentiful and well-seasoned. But this place is all about the music and the drinks, and on these they won me over. Had a simple Stella Artois apple cider (despite the great drink selection) and hubby enjoyed his porter. If you make a reservation, they give you 90 minutes to dine, which to me was more than enough. The band starts at 7pm on a weeknight, taking a 15-minute break around 8pm, and our 7:30 reservation gave us plenty of time to enjoy the music. If you visit New Orleans with older kiddies, I'd say give this place a go."
570,"There were quite a few reasons why I could not give Cheu a five-star rating but it does not include the food. First, Cheu is a small location. There are only three tables crammed into a small nook which should onlyt. Second, VERY limited seating. Therefore, this place does not offer reservations, except in extreme cases, and seating it fills up fast. 

However, the food does come out at a fast rate so I cannot see why anyone would want to eat, relax and talk for a bit. The noise level is rather loud and the music does not help in that aspect. 

Besides those little annoyances, Cheu does offer delicious ramen that is worth the wait and crammed area. The secret lies in their small menu that is precise and allows to make ramen a specialty. I tasted ramen from other restaurants and the menus tend to be huge; lots of combinations, food seems rushed and put together; but not here. 

The slices of brisket in my ramen was lean and non-fatty and the broth was absolutely delicious. Cheu does offer apps as well but you can feel up on the ramen alone; but if you must try an appetizer try the Garlic Wings or/and the Pizza Dumplings.

Back to the ramen! I added an soft boiled egg that perfectly complemented the noodles and a Spiked Juice w/ Rum to top it off. Although the noodle bar is pricey the tasty and satisfying dishes makes it worth the investment"
571,"Parking (even on a Thursday) was a pain but as long as you're ok with a little walk, it's doable. The service was spectacular. I love how in locals places staff is usually honest and laid back. The bartender/waiter extraordinaire told me he thinks mules are a joke of a cocktail and so I steered away from the Pear-a-mule and went with the good old margarita.  Cocktail-wise you really can't go wrong. We started with the chips and guac which was delicious, fresh and flavorful. We also ordered the sweet potato wedges with serrano aioli----highly recommended. I had the chimichurri sliders (they caught my eye for some reason). I seemed like and off combination but the flavors worked together and I was quite happy with my choice. (Side note: ladies, you won't be able to eat this gracefully---date tip.) Overall I'm super impressed with the service and quite happy with the food and value. It wasn't crowded when we were there but I can imagine it feels---and gets-- crowded very easily. That's just about the only downside. This is definitely good for a casual little stop with some good drinks,  some interesting food and a nice cantina feel."
572,"I've been here a few times and always enjoy their diner-style hotdogs. The place is clean and has plenty of seating. I would certainly recommend giving Texas Wieners a try. 

My one single issue: the fries.

If this place had crispy, seasoned fries instead of the soft, bland ones... they'd be unstoppable."
573,"We placed a large dinner order for take-out via Fellini's web site. When we arrived, there was no record of the order. They agreed to cook it while we waited, but when we got home with the food, half of the dinners were not correct.

The next day, I called and asked to speak with the owner/manager who got on the phone. He profusely apologized and explained the reason for the ordering snafu. He offered to re-do the order as a comp. A few days later, we ordered take-out again and he made good on his word. The dinners were ready on time and were delicious. 

Any business can experience a snafu, so it was very nice of them to own it and rectify the problem. We will definitely be back!"
574,"Oh no..I may have a new obsession. 

My experience with the bella buffalo sandwich was truly amazing. The sauce was delicious and flavorful, the mushroom fried golden to perfection. Just the perfect amount of crunch and it held up to the sauce and other toppings.  I also don't know where they get their bread, but the roll was also fresh and yummy. I devoured my whole sandwich in less than ladylike time (and demeanor). 

Will 100% be back."
575,Quality sushi for Missouri! Everything was fresh and full of flavor! Sometimes service is a bit slow but still very friendly and I've left my Fitbit there once and they kept it safe for me until I returned :)
576,"Checked this spot out with work colleagues due to its convenient location to our work (we could walk & leave cars in parking garage!).

Pleasantly blown away!

Sicilian slice with pancetta & vidalia onions was unbelievably airy & done perfectly.

Shared an Italian Caesar salad -- little heavy on dressing but loved the anchovies!

Splurged & got the sweet cream & cappuccino soft serve twist -- we all devoured this in minutes! Dining partners loved the assortment of Italian cookies (I was in gluten coma & could not do any more dough!  Fell off my GF wagon for the night). 

Would so come back again!

Get here early ... We did thankfully; was packed by 6p."
577,"Very southern, very heavy. It was on TV so I take my touristy friends sometimes but I never really come here."
578,"I was with a client and some coworkers looking for a place to grab a late lunch downtown, we were striking out all over the place. We walked in and the owner and what looked like his mother were sitting there getting a bit of rest before dinner service. Instead of turning us away, they graciously sat us and served us a fantastic meal. The food was paced well and it was prepared fresh with great ingredients. The Taj saved the day and kept us out of some crappy chain restaurant in a strip mall. 

Get a mango lhassi. It was fantastic."
579,"I was fully surprise by Beck's Cajun Cafe, I never would've thought that a hole in a wall like this place that is tucked in Reading Terminal Market would be this amazing. 

The staff behind the counter is a trio of mother and daughters working together. They are extremely nice and are willing to give you little samples of jambalaya or gumbo if you ask for it.

I had the Gator Gumbo with Rice and Fried Mac and Cheese ball. I was hoping the mac and cheese was good but it lacked cheese. A lot of mac inside but not even cheese so it was definitely a bit bland. The best part was the Gator Gumbo, packed with cajun spices and a lot of gator sausage and meat. This was absolutely amazing and a must get at Beck's.

A place worthy of a return when I visit Philly again."
580,"Been to NOLA a bunch of times, but just stumbled upon this little Whitman-loving spot this year. I absolutely adore the writing theme present throughout the space, from the literary menu to the vintage typewriters lining the walls. It's very charming!

I had a Moscow Mule which was delicious. I THINK I also had a ""Death In The Morning"" (absinthe and champagne). Tasty but a little too strong for me ... my own fault of course, the name speaks for itself.

We stopped here more than once during this trip. It's just a cozy little spot. Perfect to grab a drink, admire the books on the mantle and sit on a squishy chair by the fireplace. Friendly bartenders too!"
581,Delicious! I had the kale salad and chocolate spinach smoothie. The portions are very generous.
582,"Service, parking and location was great. Pizza and salad had great taste. It came out quick and was timed perfectly as we had to get on the road. Dough was okay - hard to eat with toppings falling off pizza"
583,"My husband and I love the early bird specials menu at La Campagnola.  Our favorite is the Pork Chop Normandy.  The chop is double thick, cooked to perfection, with a delicious sliced apple brandy cream sauce that is delicious.  The plate comes with cheesy scalloped potatoes and a freshly prepared vegetable of the day.  Homemade soup or salad is included, as well as dessert.  Our servers have always been friendly and professional, and it is such a treat when we head out for an early dinner at La Campagnola."
584,"Last weekend my girlfriend and I , both half insane with cabin fever, decided to walk up to Girard Ave and grab a bite to eat and a couple drinks. As we strolled we listed off our choices trying to make the decision as we walked...East Girard Gastropub, Kraftwork, Frankford Hall, Interstate 295...all good places to which we have already been. But as we passed each one they all looked like sardine cans. Instead of sardines they were packed with humans. Humans that smelled worse than fish in a can. So, we kept on. 

Then we passed Lloyd and decided to give it a try. My girlfriend loves whiskey,  the menu looked interesting, and it was busy, but not filled to the gills. So, in we went. 
My immediate reaction to the decor/ambiance was that it felt like an upscale VFW. The bar is adorned with mismatched stuffed armchairs (cozy!) and fun vintage wall art that has a cabin in the woods and/or dark pool hall feel. There was something just a little off on the overall vibe. I got the sense that the owners had a limited budget to dedicate towards the design and decor. Maybe it was the startlingly white acoustical grid ceiling, or the Pergo floors that make that dreadful hollow knocking sounds when you walk across them, or maybe it was the off-the-shelf white folding residential closet door covering what I assume was a storage closet. This sounds overly nit-picky, but when I think ""whiskey bar"" I imagine a dark, dimly lit, cozy space with dark (real) wood accents and leather. Also, it lacked a good seating area adjacent to the bar. A overly wide space between the tables and bar felt like an unused dance floor. 

But enough about the design of the space. Now to the important part. The food.

I got suckered into some special cocktail that was made with a whiskey that aged for 6 months in some special aged oak barrel. It was yummy, but at $13 a pop - I didn't go for another round. For food bits we got roasted beets in a siracha honey glaze, chicken liver mousse pate with bread, and a mozzarella & prosciutto with broccoli rabe sandwich. I loved the beets and the chicken liver. The sandwich was  good, but basic. There wasn't a crumb left on any of the plates and the servings were pretty generous.  The two cocktails my ladyfriend had were also super yummy, and a much more reasonable $9 a piece.

Overall I enjoyed my experience. The service was very good, the food hit the spot. I would go back again to try their other offerings. I only dwell so long on the ambiance of the place because I think they have a good thing going, but in a town like Philly where there are so many good restaurants with great atmosphere and design, a restaurant has to do more than make good food to survive long term. I hope this place continues to do well. It's great having another quality place to go to in Fishtown."
585,"OK. Decent place for pancakes and breakfast. Is it worth the ridiculous line that usually forms and runs out the door and around the corner? No. I'd rather go to Waffle House, eat, drive back home, get in comfy pj's and watch a game on the couch than still be there standing in line.

Again, good food, worth the money, not worth the ridiculous wait. Go when you can walk right in and eat without a wait. It'll make it taste better. I promise."
586,"From the outside of the Cafe, you don't really expect the inside to be that great.  But to my surprise, it was greatly decorated in Thai decor.  I liked the ambience and feel to it, because it kind of made me feel like it was an exotic escape especially from the surrounding neighborhood.  

There was plenty of seating which was great.  Most Thai restaurants I've visited have been a little smaller and more intimate, and this place gives you enough breathing room.  Coming from Chicago, my favorite place near the UIC Campus was Thai Bowl on Taylor St.  Cheap and good Thai food with a student discount and delivers to the dorms.  

The food was great, and having a Thai friend order food that I wasn't familiar with was all the better.  I'm more of an ""eat what you know"" type of person, and sometimes I'm scared to venture out.  But the Tom Kha (sp?) - Coconut (Milk) Soup was delicious.  I have to say I'm not a fan of either mushrooms or coconut, but I have to say it was a great combination.    Now to my usual order of Pad See Ew, I wasn't too impressed.  It seems like this place, along with Smiling Elephant and Royal Thai, all make their Pad See Ew with thinner (almost transparent) noodles.  I enjoy having my Pad See Ew with thicker noodles, that's basically my only complaint.  

The service was great because I went during a less busy time (I'd say mid-afternoon).  

I'm definitely coming back here again.   This place beats Royal Thai.  And I would probably choose this place over Smiling Elephant because Siam Cafe has more seating available."
587,Had some gumbo. It was very good. Nice atmosphere and excellent serves. Drinks were good too. Desserts were out of this world
588,"We love Club 21!  Our family has been coming here since the 1970s, and the food has always been excellent.  Their carne seca is the best in town and is impossible to resist--order anything with it, and you won't be disappointed.  But everything here is good, and we like that you can order a huge plateful of food, or, unlike most restaurants, you can get virtually any item a la carte if you just don't have a huge appetite.  Margaritas are freshly made, tasty, and very reasonably priced.  The staff is always friendly, and most of them have been around forever.  And we like the retro decor, as the dark bar area is where we have always chosen to sit; if you prefer it brighter, you can sit in the newer room with the big window."
589,"I have been going to Shanghai for years.  I can tell you that the food is consistent and good.  If you want gourmet Chinese food then go to PF Changs.  This is a neighborhood place and it's the standard place for my family's takeout.  My favorite is the General Tso's Chicken, Chicken and Broccoli, and the Hot & Sour soup.  As for the reviewer that complained about rodent traps.  Most restaurants have rodents! How do you think exterminators stay in business?

Update:  Just had lunch and they did a total renovation of the restaurant.  Very nice!"
590,"Three Muses is a tapas bar unlike any other I've frequented. Gone is the pretentiousness that are normally associated with tapas restaurants I've visited. Instead there was a really nice, easy going, order from any of us cause it gets loud in here type vibe.

I wish i could remember what we ordered, but there were four of us and we ordered a bit of everything. The sweet potato gnocchi was so good we had to order another round. I also had a blueberry mojito that was divine.  The food came out fast and all of it was just incredible. 

We totally would have spent some serious cash if not for another engagement we had to get to. 

Oh, get there early, cause this place will get crowded quickly. it's that good."
591,"Went for Sunday brunch. Arrived a little after 11 and the place was empty. Service was friendly and helpful. Prices on food were good, but drink prices were a little high. Definitely cheaper in Old City. Anyway, the food was great. Fresh and hot and huge portions; neither of us could come close to finishing. Only food complaint was the bacon was way under cooked; needs to be crisper.
By the time we left, the place had started to fill up, so get there early for a spot. Definitely will return."
592,"Me and my girlfriend are considering making this our regular spot.

Pros.

The ramen is great! The wings everyone is talking about are so delicious. I'm hoping to try everything on the menu. 

It's cute no seriously the only way I can describe this noodle bar is cute its like if a bunch of american teens got together and opened a noodle shop cute. I like that I can also watched the chefs make the food if I am at the bar it makes the experience a bit more interactive, I know I'm reaching but it's honestly like watching the cooking channel and them handing the food to you when its done.  

The drinks are daring and cool looking, okay im not much of a drinker in fact I prefer for my drinks to taste like anything but alcohol but still they are great to look at. 

Cons.

It's a little tight. But in today's economy most new restaurants are and I'm here for that. So leave more good reviews and hopefully in enough time they get a bigger spot.

This is more of an unpopular request but maybe a sake lemonade or sangria for us sweet cocktail lovers or a sweet cider on the beer menu. 

It's a little pricey for ramen I say that only because I realize that I pay so much because I need an appetizer with it or I won't be full. I always leave wanting more food."
593,"That chicken sandwich. Damn! 
Really great food and dessert.
The French Macaroons are awesome and try some of the other cookies and assorted goods as well. 
I just shave a star off for price as it is a bit too much. 
Otherwise, cozy and efficient little shop and definitely worth a visit if you are on the go. Not too much seating."
594,"I got late take-out from Chiang Mai.  It's nice to have a good Thai restaurant in Broad Ripple.  The Pad Thai is good, and their portions are nice.  They do not screw around when you order ""Extra-hot"", which is great.  The crab rangoon (my vice) is good too.  The folks are very nice.  The only thing keeping me from giving them a 5-star rating is that my order was take-out.  I am confident they will get 5 stars when I actually dine in."
595,"Great bbq. I love their mac and cheese,  as well as their other sides. The brisket is extremely tender,  and so is the pork. You also get free ice cream so that never hurts, lol."
596,"Fantastic restaurant concept. Good cheap food fast. Fresh, better than average ingredients. Indie background music. No complaints. 
This type of pizza is better when consumed immediately. Take out degrades rapidly."
597,"It had been a while since I had had tapas and I had heard soo much about this place so I had to try it. 

I went with 6 other people so initially we ordered a few plates to all share and then ordered our own plates. I tried the kale salad with fried goat cheese which was AMAZING! It didn't have too much dressing on it (I hate when my salad is drowning in dressing!) and was nice and crispy. It had dried cherries on which gave it a little sweetness which added a nice touch. 

I also tried the Pure de garbanzos which was also very good. It had the consistency of hummus but was much more flavorful than traditional hummus and instead of pita bread, it came with toasted bread. So yummy. 

The Gambas al Ajillo was merely shrimp in an spicy garlic oil. I was not as impressed with this dish, but the complimentary bread tasted damn good dipped in the spicy garlic oil!

Finally, the Flamenquines de Pollo which was the chicken stuffed with spinach was very good but was a bit hard to share because it was hard to cut the chicken into smaller, even pieces. I think that dish is best for one person.

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Modesto and would definitely go back for happy hour. I forgot how expensive it is to get full off of tapas!"
598,Great service. I don't think I even waited more than a minute or two each time to have my glass of water refilled. Oysters for happy hour were great. Our servers suggestion of the Crawfish Bisque was a good one.
599,"Found out about Slices a few weeks ago and it is now my go to late-night pizza spot. Cheap, quality slices. I think I got 4 for $9. Open till 3 am Friday and Saturday which is always a plus."
600,"I FINALLY got around to trying The Blue Duck Tavern. My friend and I tried the blue duck fries to start with which were great! They were covered in a Gouda sauce (which was very gooda!) and shredded duck meat. For my entree I had the Blue Jawn Burger which was covered in caramelized onion and blue cheese. I thought it was great, but a little overcooked. The onions were cooked perfectly and there was an excellent balance of blue cheese as well! The meat itself was excellent though! My friend had the fried chicken sandwich which she said was very good although it was a little sloppy because the coleslaw kind of got everywhere. I definitely would go back!"
601,"I went here with a friend of mine for a delightful mid-morning / afternoon treat.  We browsed the farmers market and found some amazing honey, salsa, meats, and more!  Then, we ended up eating in the kitchen and it was delicious!  Followed by lunch we went to the store and bought some macaroons - which was my first time to have these delicacies and they were out of this world!  Overall, we had a lovely time!"
602,"Wow! Great recommendation by the Green House Inn staff!  Happy hour was great - although there was wait to be seated (we eventually were sat in the back room that was completely empty until we were shown our table). Oysters, pate, fried oyster salad were impalpable - but food envy of neighboring tables burger, gumbo, and the special!

A must!!"
603,"Very busy most of the time and hard to get a seat, however their Pad Thai is the best in town and worth the wait!"
604,We went to dinner on a Friday night about 6:30. We'd called ahead and made a reservation not knowing if it would be busy or not. We walked in and were greeted right away. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. They brought us hot towels to freshen up. All we ordered was sushi and it came out very quickly. The Vegas Roll was IMO the best one. I also recommend the Caterpillar roll. I think the overall value was really good for our party of 6. We even got dessert afterwards. Reasonably priced.  We'd defintely go back again
605,"Went on a Tuesday night for a couple of drinks. It's the perfect relax, chill place to have some beers over nice conversation. They are pretty laid back and you can sit either inside or outside by their porch, which sometimes can be super crowded. I will definitely be back!"
606,"I didn't discover this place until a few months ago, even though I live less than 5 minutes away. It's tucked away in a small strip mall right off of Hwy. 70, behind TJ Maxx. It's definitely a hidden treasure and probably my favorite thing in the Bellevue area. 

I'm a big fan of their vanilla bean lemonade (try it - you'll like it!) and their cakes/cupcakes. My personal favorite is their Margarita cake - it's just wonderful. They also have really good vegan and gluten-free cupcakes, with plenty of flavors to choose from. 

My mouth is watering just thinking about their Margarita cake and vanilla bean lemonade... :) 

I've tried their sandwiches and lemon-artichoke soup a couple of times and they're alright - just not my thing. I think it's kind of expensive for what you get, so I just get dessert when I go there now. 

The interior is super cute and a perfect place to have lunch with your girlfriends. It does get crowded fairly quickly and parking can be at a premium during lunch time, so plan ahead."
607,"Great Food! Lots of Gluten free options!
Great Wine Selection and wonderful Cocktails
Service lacks speed but is friendly, hence go
when you are not in a rush! Make reservation for
Prime Time Dining, the place fills up!"
608,"When my bf and I looked at the rating for this place I thought, wow how come we've never gone there? Then, we finally visited Prohibition Taproom: it is a true beer place! No wonder -- I'm not a beer person.

But the experience was good. From my point of view, it looked like heaven for the beer-and-sports people. 

I liked the vibe and service, so I'm givin' it 4!"
609,"This place does a great job with its spices.  The basil chicken is flavorful and I love the mix of veggies - peppers, onions and mushrooms.  The panang curry is also food, although they serve it on blanched cabbage and I'd rather they use a few other cooked vegetables.  The chicken satay is tasty.  The tom yum is mediocre.  The fried tofu is a bit rubbery.  There are limited thai restaurants in Nashville but this place is unassuming and service is attentive.  I really do like the flavor profiles here just wished some of the ingredients were a little more thoughtful.  In my opinion, the basil chicken is quite good - the elements fresh and at spice level 2 its just the perfect meal. The four stars is really for that dish and just enjoying it satisfies my craving for thai food."
610,Great neighborhood place. They fry up some good food and their Mac and cheese is super yummy!
611,"Came in here after our red-eye flight. We were so grateful they were open already.  We ordered their eggs benedict style Arnold , banana's foster French toast, chocolate chip pancake, eggs, and bacon and hot chocolates.  The hot chocolate just hit the spot for me. I finished it almost immediately. The food was delish!!!! I shared the eggs benedict and French toast with my hubby.  They were both bomb.  It was just the right portion for us to share too.  I was hoping we could go back there again for breakfast but time was not kind to us.  We will definitely come back here when we are in the area."
612,"EAT HERE ON TUESDAY: the special is phenomenal. Call and order a large plain for pickup. Starting at 6pm, you will be charged the same amount as the time you called. Call in at 6:30pm, you get a large plain pizza for $6.30. Hard to beat. Pizza is quite good."
613,"Moving back to tampa from Baltimore I've been looking for a divey neighborhood bar that I can go to and drink and while ""the indie"" doesn't meet everything I would of hoped its the best bar I've found around.  Large rotating craft beer selection with and even superior bar staff that's friendly, knowledgeable, and locals themselves you'll quickly come to realize why this is my tampa go to bar.  Before moving to Seminole heights I was living in temple Terrace and didn't mind driving here just for a beer because of the atmosphere, the people, and the food.  

-Cool people ranging from hipsters-business professionals: check
-Beer: check (double check since they offer a great craft selection)
-atmosphere with a great outdoor patio where the neighborhood meets: check
-food (which is not your typical low quality bar food) while not a requirement for me has come in handy on the nights I end up spending 3+ hrs here lost in conversation: check

 
Overall it's my favorite bar in tampa.  Alas it's not anything like what I long for, which is a divey bar like Mt Royal Tavern in Baltimore, it certainly has picked up the gauntlet of being my go to everyday bar since I've moved.  Love it or hate it I don't care the staff here will keep making me broker for many moons to come."
614,"If you're looking for the perfect post-beach snack, this it!
I didn't realize how close it was to Lower State street and a little walk to the beach.

To switch things up, I ordered the Dragon Bowl which had pitaya, mangoes, kiwis, and bananas. The texture of the acai was very different. It had a glue-like texture rather than the classic icy-smoothie style. Besides the texture throwing me off, this was great! The sliced fruit was fresh and the acai wasn't so cold that it gives me a brain freeze! What really surprised me was how big the portion was. If you're not that hungry, I would recommend splitting this with someone or getting the kiddie bowl. 

The acai bowls are a little more on the pricier side~ $9 but it is a filling meal. 

There's free parking for the first 75 minutes in the lot across the way."
615,"We went to this place after looking on Yelp--duh. We were a group of about 10 and needed somewhere to go that would be able to serve all of us. As soon as we got there we notices the place was packed and everyone was happily eating. The food is served family style and we had a mix of different people including my boyfriend who loves food the spicier the better, my grandmother and picky little me. We ordered a couple of apps and entrees for all of us to share. The food was excellent, with some of it being a bit too spicy for my taste. We ordered more than enough and the bill only came out to $13 per person! Which--when it comes to my family, that small of a bill is amazing!"

Thanks Yelpers. This was a winner. The portions were generous. The fish excellent - few get excellent for the fish. Simply said - why eat sushi - for the fish. 
Tuna,salmon, white tuna, yellow tail. Great

Soup ok but not why I was there. Service good. Price - always spend too much with my teenage sushi loving companions but pricing was a bit lower than some others. 

Had a spicy tuna roll as well - good for a roll.  Companion had Fantasy Roll - it was very good. 
Interesting if straightforward layout. Clean."
617,"Ate at this restaurant while attending the Sugar Bowl and had a good time. The place definitely is a ""hole in the wall"". It's located on a busy intersection and the exterior looks run down. We arrived around 6pm and there was already a line. We had to wait about 30 mins before we got a table. The interior was no different from the outside. It was small, it had cheap tables and chairs, and was cramped. 

As with most other reviewers, the food and service more than made up for the rundown decor. Our waitress was nice and professional and food was quick to arrive. We got a dozen oysters, blackened alligator, and seafood basket. Oysters were fresh, the alligator was tasty, and the seafood were cooked perfectly. 

Overall, this was a nice restaurant outside of downtown NOLA. If you can get over the ""hole in the wall"" atmosphere, then this is a place to visit."
618,"Amazingly good nachos with beef, I would go here just to get them. Pulled pork sandwich was very good too. Tons of good looking items on the menu. I tried to goto brunch on sunday and the wait was 2 hours so go early if you want breakfast or your gonna be waiting sucka."
619,"Just moved to the area and was really excited to try a new restaurant. Masami did not disappoint! The hibachi was delicious! I always use a basic sushi roll as a measuring stick to decide whether or not the sushi is fresh/good and the Philadelphia roll was 2 thumbs up!

I would've rated my experience a 5..but I felt like the hibachi chef could've been better. He had a dull personality compared to most.

I will definitely be back!"
620,"I thought I reviewed Luke last time I came back from Nola, but I see that I was remiss.  This is place is a solid win.  My fiance always gets the burger and it's huge, juicy self is complimented with perfectly cooked shoestring fries.  I loooove the crab and corn soup and wish I could have vats of it shipped to me during the cold NYC winters.  It's spicy, flavorful and full of fresh crab meat and plump kernels of corn straight off the ear.  The P&J oysters are a must, especially with that damn delicious crust.  I definitely scraped the remainders of it off the shells with my bread (that was warm and soft).  As for drinks, go with the Cypress in the summer--crazy refreshing and strong without tasting like straight liquor.  Great service and casual, upscale atmosphere."
621,"Found it on Yelp (because you do NOT eat sushi in a new city without reading anything), and have to agree: this is solidly four stars.  The sushi is slightly overpriced (compared to the West Coast anyway) but fresher than I expected, and the presentation is really superb."
622,"very good seafood,very fresh,ate here three times on two different visits to S.B. There is a wait for tables ,but who cares. the view is great ."
623,"When with some local friends for dinner and drinks and it was a cool place, definitely very trendy with the old warehouse feel and wood and industrial vibe. They brew there own beers as the name suggests, I had the copperhead pale ale which was very good. I had the Reuben and it was great, lots of meat piled high, also had the beer battered fried and they were awesome...highly recommend the fries. Others had bacon cheeseburgers and they enjoyed them. Good place to meet friends for food and drinks."
624,"Caveat to this review - this is still their ""soft"" opening.

We decided at the last minute to walk over for dinner and check out the menu before the crowds start coming in.

They are off to a good start. We were seated at a high-top by the bar, not my favorite spot, but it will do. The interior has not changed at all so it looks cool and urban and hip and classy-casual as usual. 

Our meals were very good and the food was all fresh and hot and very nicely presented. I had the Chicken Picatta and the portion was generous. The sauce was pleasantly lemony with capers all placed over a very nice menage of fresh corn and other veggies. There were mashed potatoes on the side. It was flavorful and nicely cooked. The chicken breast was tender and juicy.

The service was a bit uneven. We were given menus and he took our drink order after pouring the water. There was a bit of a wait getting our drinks. I am not sure what the hold up was, it was not that busy. We asked to have some time to enjoy our drink and look through the menu. Our waiter returned in due time - about 10 - 15 minutes and we said we were ready to order. My husband ordered another wine - and it never came. So we reorder when he came by to ask if we wanted another drink. I am not sure whether he forgot to put in our drink order, of there was a tie-up at the bar.

We are looking forward to coming back again and trying some of their other dishes and giving a try to their appetizers."
625,"We wanted breakfast at 10:30 am on a Friday, so we used Yelp and went to this place.  It was exactly what we wanted.  We sat outside on the patio and enjoyed the weather while eating our food.  The Make your Own Hash was so good, I practically licked my plate clean.  I also tried the wheat toast with homemade strawberry jam.  It was tasty.  I wish I could take a jar home with me.  We might even return tomorrow for breakfast again.  The only reason I could not give them 5 stars was the service.  It wasn't bad, just nothing impressive."
626,"Ok so this was my first vegan meal and it did not disappoint. I ordered the chipotle ""chicken"" wrap with cabbage and sweet potato fries with siraracha aioli which was delicious! 

The location itself is a quaint spot located in university city and the staff was very pleasant.

They had delicious looking desserts which I did not partake in but I look forward to to trying some my next time back."
627,"Cheu has really come into its own. When I was last here half a year ago, I was less-than-impressed, but this time, the staff was friendlier and the ramen was close to perfect.

We came for a late lunch, minutes before they were supposed to close at 3pm. The waiter still good-naturedly accommodated us, providing fast and attentive service. 

The noodles were chewy, and whereas last time they were a little clumpy, this time, they were perfect. The broth was not too salty and somehow managed to be full flavored and (refreshingly) light at the same time. The meat was meltingly tender, though a little broken-up for my tastes, and the soft-cooked egg was perfect.

We also ordered a special grapefruit juice, whose tart flavor complimented the ramen and served nicely as a palate cleanser.

After eating ramen, I often fall into a sodium stupor and feel mildly ill for at least half a day, but after Cheu ramen, I felt pleasantly full. The attentive service and delicious ramen made for a much-improved experience."
628,Great local pizza with awesome owner and employees. Authentic NY style pizza at a great price. They also have great sandwiches especially the pulled pork. Open late for midnight snacks and have great lunch time specials. If you work around Westshore Joes pizza is a great spot to grab a quick bite to eat.
629,We were there for a group birthday  (as well) and it was wonderful. Our servers were very attentive. No one in our group left hungry. Grab your favorite bottle and enjoy a good meal at this little gem.
630,"Great burgers, very good value for your money. Family friendly, good service, pretty clean. Will be returning."
631,"I have been here a few times now and have never been disappointed. Everything is pretty delicious. The $5 milkshakes are freaking amazing. I will say that it's a little on the pricey side for what it is, but the food is tasty and the atmosphere is nice. I will definitely be back!"
632,"Pizza was great, delivery was quick, and the delivery man was nice. All-in-all a great pick for anyone enduring long nights of studying."
633,The sandwich was fantastic!  The last time I was here was around 10 years ago and I remembered it being good. It still is! The shop on the inside could use a little refresher with decorating a little less clutter but as far as the food... best sandwiches I've had in town!
634,"We started with a basic house margaritas and free chips and salsa.  The drinks were good and the salsa was great.  It was nice and chunky and filled with cilantro.  Next up were the steak fajitas.  They had a nice taste and the spice they used was just right.  The onions were heaped on the platter but there were so few poblano peppers as to be almost nonexistent.  And what happened to the nice red, white, and green Mexican flag presentation you normally see with fajitas?  No tomatoes!  To complete the ""flag"" I put a little salsa on top and that did the trick.

All in all the place was better than average.  Good, in fact.  We will certainly return to try more items on the menu."
635,"Lured by the constant advertisements of $33 for 3 small plates and a glass of wine, my family and I ended up at Ralph's on a beautiful Sunday night. We made reservations, but it really wasn't necessary as it was pretty empty... I am not sure it is like this all the time, so be safe and make one. We have been here twice and the dress is ""smart casual"", whatever that is... meaning we saw everything from shorts and tanks to very nice dresses. Take it as you will, and dress at your comfort level. 
The service: The service was exceptional, if not a little too friendly.. i.e. our waiter literally stood over my husband to see how he liked the turtle soup... He then proceeded to try to list the 27 ingredients. I chalk it  up to he was young and new to the business, and really took to the whole chit-chat with customers bit a little too seriously. Once he got other tables things mellowed out and we really enjoyed ourselves. 
Our daughter ordered off the kids menu, which is a set 3 course meal for $12. It truly was a bargain, and the staff took great care to make sure her order paired our food as far as the timing of things coming out. My husband and I each ordered the three plate deal. Honestly, there was so much food that I could only eat half of what I ordered. My husband, on the other hand, practically cleaned the plates. Everything we had (turtle soup, tuna duo, truffle fries, oysters, crabmeat deviled eggs, beef mole sopes), was delicious! 
I definitely recommend Ralph's"
636,"This is really great pizza. The Hawaiian pizza has fresh pineapple not from a can. They will make pizza slices with what you want, but they don't really want to. Compared to what is in the area, this one is the best pizza."
637,"The food is great, the service is fantastic, and everything is composts me or recyclable! The prices can be just a bit steep which is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. I felt $21 for a burger, fries, and a milkshake was too much but it was forgone toy some of the yummiest vegan food I have ever had. Seating is limited at this restaurant as it's mostly a takeaway spot. Plan to most likely get your food to go."
638,"I love Natural Cafe! Delicious and fresh food and you can get anything from salads to pasta to salmon, rice, and veggies. I also love the environment and the little flowers they have on every table. I've had a few subpar interactions with the employees there but nothing to stop me from coming back."
639,"Great place to go for large gatherings/groups! Family-style eating is best here and even though the taste isn't as authentic as Chili Szechuan on 42nd and Chestnut, that doesn't mean this place isn't wonderful. This place is great for those who love spicy food. I love the Dan dan noodles here! So addicting and the dry pot chicken is awesome. Another recommendation is cumin style chicken, bokchoy with black mushrooms, and scallion style (not spicy)!"
640,"On the up side, it's not a chain.  Nice place, well kept.  Staff was friendly.  The sandwich was great!  

On the down side, mac and cheese premium side was a bit small on the portion and served at room temp.  Drink refills would have been an extra plus.

Worth a stop if you are passing thru."
641,"Got the early bird special of steak and fries - subbed mashed potatoes, added broccoli. Asked for butter on the side for broccoli, but that didn't happen. The sirloin was good, but cooked well done when I ordered it medium. These couple of flubs make the difference between a 4&5 star rating to me. I ordered a glass of the one hope cab sav and it was quite delicious - sweet and spicy, not too dry. 

The carrot cake here is to die for - definitely save room and get it. Amazingly delicious!"
642,"Pretty straight forward. 

Chicken fingers, fries cole slaw and some Texas toast. It's simple and good. 

The sauce definitely makes it. Remember to get some sweet tea to wash it down."
643,"I'm typically a carnivore, but Hip City Veg was very tasty!  I had the fajita wrap for lunch.  It was a little pricey (around $9) for me, but it was big and filling and delicious.  It was busy around lunch but the service was apt and friendly."
644,"We stayed at the intercontinental during our visit and this place was a no brainer in terms of the proximity to our hotel and the reviews. We dragged our hungover asses out of bed and walked in here with hopes of eating some delicious food and a well needed dose of caffeine. We each got started with coffee, which was absolutely fantastic. I ordered the southern breakfast and requested toast instead of sausage, while my friends ordered the soft shell crab and crab omelet. I loved the food I ordered.. except everything lacked a little seasoning. Also, the bacon was completely dry. I love bacon in any shape or form, so I didn't seem to mind the lack of grease. The jalapeno grits were spectacular and so was the biscuit. My friends seemed to really enjoy their breakfast as well. The fries again, lacked seasoning which seemed odd. How does one forget to add salt to fries? We were too hungover to notice or care.. Overall, its a pretty good place if you're looking for decent French food."
645,"Don't let the size of the place fool you!  It's tiny with small tables and you'll have to twist your way around the chairs to get to the back corner, but the food is great.

I really appreciate that the rice they served with the curry was a good hefty helping and not dry like other places.  The curries are really rich with flavor...so good!  The price is pretty much about $10-12 per person on average for a standard plate.  It goes up a bit for the more fancy add-ins.

And for those of you who can't handle spicy too well like me, don't forget to request it mild because they won't ask you how you like it and it'll come served with a kick like it's supposed to (still yummy though...just order two more glasses of water lol).  We ordered the pumpkin curry, pineapple curry, and pad thai.

Love the food, but the venue is pretty cramped."
646,Best pizza on lower Main Line; great friendly staff
647,"Stopped in for dinner, and we had a fantastic experience. The service was pleasant, the food delicious plus the atmosphere was very welcoming. Mike the owner, said hello to us and just made us feel very at home. We will be back!"
648,"Stopped in for a late lunch upon arrival. We were famished. Our server was on the case and he took great care of us. Made recommendations regarding menu items and drink suggestions--everything spot on. My oysters were fresh and tasty. The boiled shrimp were incredible--a huge portion and SO fresh. Crab cakes were big and crisp. Loved my cup of gumbo as well. Even though it was hot outside and all the windows were open, it was nice and cool inside due to the many large overhead fans. Go here."
649,"I always think it's a good sign when you go to an international place and see people of that origin eating there. Haveli was packed for the $7.99 lunch buffet. So it was a good sign for me. Plus it kept lots of fresh samosa coming. 

Another great thing here is that you get fresh garlic or regular naan served table side. 

Good food, service, the ambiance is a little dated? With maroon carpet and industrial ceiling.. But I'm ok with it when I'm drowning myself in tikka masala and palak paneer. 

Pro-tip- print out the coupons from website to save yourself a buck or two."
650,"A limerick about why I give Chatham 4 awesome stars:
Chatham has Indiana sips
So I give them mucho tips.
The lights are too dim,
And without soccer they're grim, 
But I live for another side of chips. 

Eat pizza with toppings galore,
Can bring a group of four ...or more!
Lots of sports on the tellies, 
Big portions to fill bellies, 
And a comedy club next door!"
651,"""Just because it's vegan, doesn't mean it's healthy"" reported a friend of a friend, and I think he's totally right--in a good way.

On one of the first chilly days of Fall, I was not in the mood to gnaw on a fibrous salad for lunch. I wanted something warm and indulgent--and just vegan and eco-friendly enough for me to bask in a little first-world smug.  So, I got the crispy chick'n sandwich and sweet potato fries; both of these items really just hit the spot.  If you're looking for a healthier meal there are other items to choose from, and honestly, other places to go in the city. However, if you're looking to fill a Chik-fil-a sandwich sized hole in your soul--this may be for you.

Some notes: Sandwich is very good--bun may be a little much and they may be a tad generous with their ranch dressing, but these things are easily amended.

Fries--great--and this was after having to walk it back to my office a half mile away (yes, in the cold). What makes it better are the sauces: siracha aoli (YUM!) and black bean cilantro (yum).

Overall service was really personable and decor was lovely. Yes, it is a little pricey, but most vegan options tend to be..and yes, it relies heavily on faux meats, but keep in mind that sandwich sized hole in your soul."
652,"Good, fresh, clean. Nice folks. Funny soundtrack playing, but despite the 90's pop it feels authentic."
653,"Ready for some unique meat burgers?

From Bison to Elk, Bareburger has you covered. Not to be left out, they also boast a nice selection for vegetarians.

While here on a visit, I had the El Matador.  A Bison burger with Queso Fresco, pickled jalapenos, guacomole. green leaf, and pico de gallo on a brioche bun. 

Can you say mouth party?!  Between the juiciness of the bison burger and the snap of the jalapenos & pico de gallo; I was delighted. 

In addition to my burger I noshed on the spicy pickles and fries with an assortment of dips. 

If I ever find myself in the area again, I will not hesitate to make stop."
654,"Their sushi is on par with others in the area like Sushi Ninja and Sushi Maru. I always get either the Volcano, Mexican, or Yummy rolls. Can't go wrong with these choices!"
655,"This place is close to where I work, so I go here a lot for lunch or dinner.  The food is awesome!  If you have a choice between the misou soup or the mushroom soup, go with the mushroom soup, AWESOME.  I love the sushi, super fresh and they make pretty cool designs on the plate.  I've had hibachi here also, so good.  I ate everything.    The prices are decent.  

I didn't give it 5 stars because they only serve beer and wine, which is not what I want to drink when I go out for sushi.  I want some cool cocktails!  Also, the on the inside, the place is beautiful, but it looks seriously sketchy on the outside.  Why are the blinds closed???  it makes me think (what the heck are they doing in there at night?  It's uncomfortable."
656,"very clean establishment. the service was friendly enough, the food was piping hot, and the roti was delicious! good vegetarian options and they label which of their dishes are safe for vegans, gluten-free, lactose-free, etc.

as said by others, this is basically indian fast food. i would recommend it!"
657,"So. Good. 

I've tried other rib tips in the city, but I always come back to Black Diamond. These are the most tender rib tips I've had here. Sometimes, they almost fall apart. The sauce is the perfect consistency. It coats every rib tip and it won't drop off should you feel the need to dip into it (guilty). The barbecue fairies must have sprinkled some of their magic dust into that sauce. I usually get the sweet one. I tried a spicy one years ago and hated it. It was spicy with no flavor, if that even makes sense. I'll stick with the sweet. 

The sides? Meh. The mac and cheese used to be amazing, but now it tastes like noodles and cheap, fake cheese. The baked beans are just okay. They're a bit tangy and sweet. I could take them or leave them. The gumbo? Don't do this to yourself. It wasn't at all what I expected. There's no way that a roux was made. If so, the consistency is way off. This was more like chicken soup with little to no flavor. No thanks. 

I'll keep going back for the rib tips and the pulled sandwiches."
658,"Without a doubt. ....some of the best barbeque I've had this side of Texas.  The meat was smoked so well, you didn't need sauce.  It was offered on the side and the sauces were good too. I also had their collard greens and mac and cheese.  My sister had the smoked wings and she said they were delish. Her cocktail was a Metropolitan that had kick.
The staff was friendly and offered a shot that tasted like apple pie. The bar is loaded with tasty treats including Jameson Cask Mates.
My sister lives in Texas and I live in California. We were in town for a family funeral but next time we're here,  we'll come back. Highly recommended by our cousin Scott."
659,"Went to this place with a coworker 2 days ago...very impressed by the sushi there because they are very freshly made with good variety. They have good price for lunch special - $13 for 3 rolls and $9 for 2 rolls...however, the portion is a bit small for those non-special sushies. I will go back again for sure..."
660,"Got the charbroiled oysters. They were great. Little heavy on the garlic. Took a while, but I was made aware there would be a wait."
661,"Great pizza pie.  Stellar crust and ingredients, not overcooked.

The place is stylish but fun.  The HVAC is poorly designed (causing drafts where seats next to each other vary wildly in comfort).

Worse, the service is a mess.  When we finally got a waitress, she was great; but there was much confusion getting one in the first place.  I think they can earn that last star and a place among my favourites as they work out these kinks.  The &#960; is worth it."
662,"We've had mostly great experiences in the past here, but we went again recently and were pretty disappointed.  The waitress was aloof, slow, and not friendly at all.  When we looked at our menus, we realized they had significantly raised their prices since the last time (probably by 20-25% on the entrees).  We were unadventurous and both order the salmon with mustard butter sauce, which we've both really enjoyed in the past.  Unfortunately, my salmon was a little undercooked and my wife remarked that the salmon quality was not as good as before.  The sauce was definitely off as well--overly salty and not much of the good ground mustard flavor (I think they just went heavy on the salted butter).  The food was disappointing, especially since we were paying 20-25% more than the time before."
663,"We came with the family for a late lunch. Kids each had a kid's meal; adults each had a pizza. We had an order of bread sticks as well. Service was friendly, but it took a long time for our food to come, despite the short cooking time of the pizza in the fire. Kid portions are small, but I have kids on the older side of kid menu appropriateness. Adult pizzas were spectacular. I had the wild mushroom (with added bacon). Other adult was a different veggie Pizza, also very good. Kids described the pepperoni as just right in spiciness, with a nice crispiness.  All in all, we enjoyed it and will return. Just make sure you have enough time in your schedule if you go."
664,"Great Mexican food at Ucity. I was a bit skeptical going in on a Wednesday night, but the environment was very homely (the murals are a bit sketchy though) and the staff very helpful. 
They have 'free' nachos like most mexican places these days, but the salsa was delicious (I had to stop myself from overeating nachos before my meal).
Being a vegetarian, I can't get into the majority of the menu, but my colleagues can attest to it's quality and the staffs willingness for customization. I felt my enchilada was just right. Portions are great too !
Definitely would revisit !"
665,"Ordered from here for the first time tonight. I got jalepeno poppers which were by far the best i've ever had, although they were a little pricey.

I also ordered a small plain pizza, and after I finished off the poppers I opened up the pizza and realized there were mushrooms on it.  I was alright with that, to me I just got lucky with a free topping, but if it had been some kind of meat I would have been pretty bummed (I'm a vegetarian).  The pizza was really tasty, Crust was a little softer then I prefer but it was real good. I will definitely order from here again, maybe not for a little while just cause it is more expensive then other places.

Also delivery was fast, and the guy called me right when he got to my house. A big problem I have with delivery places is when they call before they actually get to your house, cause I live pretty far out in the ghetto and I don't like standing around outside after they call... but these guys were right out front when they called me."
666,"Love love love their pizza!!!!!  We went there for the first time tonight. We started with the honey buffalo wings. This is probably the only reason they got 4 and not 5 stars. The wings were on the small side. Aside from that they were not crispy and I didn't taste any honey in the sauce. I'd probably order them again but make sure you specify extra crispy. The pizza however, was awesome. I got the Parma. I made sure they added the arugula AFTER the pizza was cooked. It was so good that even though I'm stuffed I can't wait until I'm hungry again so I can enjoy my leftovers!  They also had a twisted pretzel beer that tasted like a pretzel!!!  It was so good and not heavy even though it was a dark beer. Make sure to go next door and get some gelato for dessert."
667,"Brunch was solid. I got the Stack, friends got French Toast w/ Brie cheese. Coffee was good, wait time was minimal and service was great. Highly recommended."
668,I tried the Diablo omelette I like spicy and it was delicious staff was friendly good Corner Cafe
669,"Our very foodie friend Marc recommended 
Mr B's as one of his top 3 in NOLA. We had a truly delicious dinner at KPaul's the night before, and we had high expectations. We walked in with a conference group of 6. Restaurant was fancy and crowded but they were able to seat us right away! Everyone enjoyed. The gumbo appetizers, 3 soup sampler, artichokes, and fried oysters were amazing. Best fried oysters ever. Huge pork chop. Red snapper delicious but portion a little small. Nearby tables had their famous shrimp--looked messy and tasty. We tried 3 of their desserts--all good, especially pecan pie. Three amazing servers for our table--very attentive. Definitely worth it."
670,"I don't always go to Prohibition Taproom, but when I do:
1 - I will probably just have a Yards Brawler, b/c I'm not a huge beer drinker and I know I like Brawler
2 - I might try another British style beer
3 - I will ALWAYS order the beer battered green beans, b/c they are light, refreshing, and I don't feel like I'm being too unhealthy
4 - I will complain about the loudness; the small room acoustics are seriously out of control once it starts to fill up (and it is almost always full).

Honestly, we would probably go here more but it's just a bit out of our way as far as local places.  But when we're going to the Troc or seeing a show at Arts Underground then we always make Prohibition a stop.  Nice, accommodating staff, nice, clean decor and nice food. Dig it!"
671,Beer selection is good. Food is quality. Atmosphere is one of the best on mass ave. the staff is very friendly which makes the meal taste that much better. Wings are quality with good flavor. Always on the list for a quick pint after work.
672,This place is great.  You can eat or just shop.  Everyone is helpful and friendly.  Lovely local shop.
673,"Use to come here all the time but it changed hands and I didn't care for the quality or change in atmosphere.  We tried it one more time after a two year hiatus to see if Wimpy's had reestablished itself.   

Gone is the kitchy decor.   While it still has that subway blue and white tile, the walls have been painted red and more tables have taken he place of a high counter.   We were suspicious at first of the empty parking lot at 5:30 on a Friday night.   However, our experience overall was positive and eventually the place started to fill up.

We shared a basket a fries, a chili cheese dog, and a cheeseburger.  All were good.   The chili cheese dog was quite large.  The burger tasted fresh, not frozen, as did the fries.   The rolls are a bit large relative to the amount of meat but were definitely a better quality than the usual burger place.  $14 for these thee items.

I was put off by the fact that we asked for two cups for water and the guy at the counter put the cups lip down onto the counter.  Used a straw to drink.   The same guy asked us is we wanted to ""start off with a milkshake.""  Uh no, it's 40 degrees and raining out.

The place is wheelchair accessible with a ramp in the front and a h/c accessible restroom."
674,"Had a date night here and really enjoyed the food. The restaurant is a bit noisy but overall ambiance is cozy. We had the flash friend Brussels sprouts to start which were very tasty! I ordered the Amish chicken which was so tender and juicy even leftover. My only suggestion for the $18 Amish chicken is to add heartier vegetables-- bigger chunks of potatoes, squash, and zucchini."
675,"I truly enjoyed this spot. I hate chain restaurants, especially for breakfast! I am a pancake girl and this place hit the spot. The type of flour utilized is top notch and the creme syrup was an excellent addition. It was such a kerfuffle trying to get a seat and I felt rudely looked over at times but I'll know how to navigate it next time."
676,For me it was easy and fast to order on my way to go.. delicious and best lamb biryani I ever had
677,"$8 Pad Thai for lunch - quite tasty. Great to have a Thai restaurant in the Melrose neighborhood. Service was a bit slow, but everyone is super nice."
678,"My husband and I were in the neighborhood and gave this place a try this past Friday! It's only $8.99 for the buffet, which is less expensive than all of the other Indian buffets I've been to in the city. But don't think that a lower price tag means bad quality! I was very pleased with everything that I tried and there were plenty of different choices! I felt like the quality of the food and the amount of options were comparable to the other more expensive buffets I've tried in the city. Why pay more??"
679,We ate here as a walk in birthday celebration dinner on a busy Saturday night. The host was very accommodating and found us a table quickly.  The service was great and the food was fabulous.  This is a great local place with a wonderfully cozy atmosphere. We live in a town with few really good food options so this is a great option if u are looking to stay close but have a great meal. The location on the river is beautiful too. Would be great if there was a real outdoor seating option.
680,It was yummy.  A real dining experience.  Boneless steak and curry Chicken were the best.   Grill is in table and it is all u can eat.
681,"I have always enjoyed this chain. I've been here so many times, I'm surprised this is my first time leaving review. Anyway, we stopped in, and shared a salad and Greek quesadillas (I think they gave it a quirky name but I can't remember it).

The food came out quickly and tasted good as always. So why the 4 stars and not 5? Well the staff of 3 were sitting at a table right by the register, and they all looked miserable. I looked their way and smiled when I was standing there two feet away ordering, and nothing, from any of them. It was just weird. Additionally, we were charged full price for those quesadillas even though we didn't have any meat. They ended up just making us extra quesadillas. And lastly, it was FREEZING inside. I can't imagine sitting there eating, so we sat outside.

Overall it was a good experience. Yeah there are tweaks to be made, but the food is very good."
682,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I first walked into Bevan's last weekend for quick lunch takeout while we were renovating our house, but I was pretty impressed. The woman at the front could not speak perfect english, but she was very helpful nonetheless. I am gluten free, which posed a bit of an issue at a deli, but we worked around it. My boyfriend was happy with his turkey and cheese and I got a cheesesteak with no bun, which was very good. They also appear to have great lunch specials that I'll keep in mind when I'm working from home in the future. 

What I didn't know about Bevan's is that they are also a little grocery store as well - carrying food, paper goods, even toys for kids! This was very good to know.

Finally, they accept credit cards ($10 min) which was a big help."
683,The service was great and they got us to a table really quick. The flavors were good and tasty. Perfect for a lunch date.
684,"I came here with friends on a Fri or Sat night b/ Stella and Irene's Cuisine were full.  I couldn't be happier w/our luck.  

I made a meal of starters b/c none of the entrees were really firing me up.  I had the pork cheeks, the gnocchi, and the duck leg confit for a little less than $30.  The food was amazing and I was happy with everything.  The portions were very large (especially the duck).

This is a great choice if you want a change from seafood (though they have seafood as well) without spending a ton of money or waiting behind crowds of people.  Would definitely go back"
685,"I used to live a few doors down from Las Cazuelas in 2005 and went there faithfully because the food is DELICIOUS! I dont' know if they still make it, but the Chilean sea bass with pumpkin mole was one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten. 
My husband and I visited last Sunday for Brunch and we ordered a TON of food because we had a $50 gift certificate to use up. I can highly reccommend the Huevos Divorciados and the Omlette Poblano. I am a poblano and mushroom lover and the oaxaca cheese melts into the eggs and veggies in the most wonderful way. My husband had the Divorciados and it was both unusual and tasty! 
My favorite at Las Cazuelas are the tacos- the steak with fresh onions and cilantro is by far the winner in my book and I confess, I have dreamed of them and often cannot resist the urge to go get a big plate of them! We tried the marinated steak tacos this time and did not like them very much- there was a red coating of marinade on the steak and it was overwhelming. You could not taste the yummy, meat-y, grilled flavor that is so great in the regular steak tacos. My husband loved the shredded pork tacos and I thought they were ok. The shrimp tacos are always a winner and taste fresh, crisp and light. I suppose it is the pure flavors and how they usually treat the fresh ingredients that brings me back time and again, I will veer away from the overly marinated items in the future. As always, the cafe de Olla (coffee with cinnamon +) and desserts are very good. I tell everyone about this place and always bring it up as an option when we have folks in from out of town. Keep up the great work!!"
686,"When I am back in the Indy area, this place will be on my list of potential places to visit. It was packed on a Wednesday night at 7pm, which I actually saw as a good sign and the service and quality of the food definitely met my expectations. My expectations were lower based on the fact that it is part of a small restaurant group, but they were exceeded by the experience and ambiance. The salads are all good and the salmon was cooked really well. I guess I could even say that the portion was too big for me (which is rare for me!), but overall I left with no complaints and the bread was really good!"
687,"I come here all the time.  They have a great beer selection.  They have great service in the bar.  The dining area can be really slow, but I always go when it is busy, so that might explain it.  

Love the taco salad with beef, the wings, sandwiches and the ovals!"
688,"Delicious coffee and espresso drinks and a cute little cafe. If you come during the morning rush hour, be prepared to wait a while for your drink. There are a decent number of seats here, but again, if you come in the morning, you might feel a little uncomfortable with the people in line crowding your space. I am a big coffee drinker, so I like that their refills are 75 cents, if I remember correctly. The baristas are also very friendly.

My major problem with La Columbe is their lack of wifi. It's the 21st century, guys! It's a good place to hang out for a few hours with a friend or do some non-computer-requiring work, but the lack of wifi is seriously limiting."
689,"Great dessert place after eating a great meal downtown.  The selections vary but you can get any gelato that your heart and tastebuds desire.  I got the bitter almond and sweet Amish milk,  it was great combo and rich milky gelato.  

Skip the mediocre dessert at the restaurants and get some top class frozen gelato."
690,I did not expect this random Taiwanese restaurant outside of Circus Circus was actually REALLY GOOD for American-Taiwanese food standard. Get the braided pork bowl and rolled pancakes.
691,"All of the previous reviews are fairly spot-on. This is a little hole-in-the-wall place. It has a definite Mom and Pop feel. The decor is ok.
I had the Potato Skins as an appetizer. Wow, that was a huge order! They could have been heated a little more, but I can't complain otherwise.
For my entree, I went with my personal benchmark, Chicken Fried Steak. The portion was huge, and I'm pretty sure it was hand-breaded, and likely in their fried chicken breeding. This is a GOOD thing. In addition, it came with two sides. Green beans were delicious and bacony, and the 4-cheese Mac and Cheese was good...and a little kick of heat!
Overall, this isn't fine dining by any stretch. But it's good basic homestyle.
I will return...if I ever stop feeling so stuffed!!"
692,"Went on a Monday and stood in line for an hour. Service was good and the host was amazing. That man should totally get a raise. Overall food was good, but not worth the wait. For that long I guess I was expecting amazing pancakes, but they were just some good old fashion pancakes. But I guess it's just one of those Nashville traditions you have to try once."
693,"I have had two very good experiences here. One weeknight they had live music and the musician dedicated songs to my friend and I the whole evening- very cute and charming. My favorite item was the combo fajitas of chicken, steak, and shrimp - huge portions and great taste. Would definitely recommend if you're in the Fats City area."
694,"Great food and nice service. My husband and I went with another couple and brought a bottle of white wine (no corking fee). We ordered vegetarian - a super yummy paneer tikka masala and another very good dish - I think it was the alu gobi.

The ambiance is nice and pretty formal-ish. At least for dinner, it's one of those places you could feel comfortable dressing up pretty well or coming in with jeans and a decent shirt.

You don't get super massive portions: my husband and I shared two main dishes and only had a little bit left. But I thought it was a good price. Their menu is online if you Google it.

I've eaten Indian in a fair number of different places - homemade and in restaurants - and was happy with this place. It certainly isn't the best I've had, but it's better than OK. I'd recommend it, and I'll go back with friends."
695,"I don't think I've eaten this much in a really long time.  I think we ate almost everything on the menu.  Literally.  There were only three of us.  Fortunately, the tables are close together so we made friends with our neighbors, and ended up sharing our bounty with them.  Ha.  

Most things were really good- we were starving though and waited over an hour to get seated.  The meat and cheese plate stands out.  I'm a sucker for cheese.  Other notable menu items are:  fried pickles (actually, they were amazing), french fries (sooo good), the lamb sliders weren't that good in my opinion, but the masses seem to like them (read in other reviews).  Something with mustard sauce, maybe egg rolls, or shrimp tempura were good- obviously, the condiment was the one that stood out to me.  That boolgogi bowl was really good too.  I think we had the mac and cheese too.  

So aside from this being a testimonial to me being a total cow- the main thing you should draw from this review is that, aside from the great music here, the food and drinks are good.  I think I stuck to wine because the cocktails were a little strange to me.  I'd go back."
696,"I really enjoyed my mussels and the atmosphere in Tavern, but this place wasn't the homerun I expected. We had a 20 minute wait on a game day, so I thought that was very reasonable. Tavern has a ton of TVs, so it's great for watching a game. The bartenders were pretty quick to provide drinks as we waited, and the craft brew and cocktail menu is good. There isn't a very expansive selection, but what's available is diverse. The food is pretty stellar as well. My mussels were delicious and our nacho appetizer was great without any meat. Fresh jalapeños, black beans, and the perfect amount of cheese made them a delight. Our server is what missed the mark. She was courteous for sure, but her timing was really off. It took a while for us to order once seated and she altered between smothering us or ignoring the table. I also wasn't impressed with my friends' lamb tacos. The tacos come in an order of two or three, and this place seems to be stingy with the meat filling. I'd definitely recommend a side an order of three. 

All and all, I'd come back. This place is tasty, but it's not the pinnacle of dining."
697,Ordered a large pizza-1/2 pepperoni and 1/2 cheese. The crust is not too thin and not oily at all. I subtracted 1 Star because I found it a little too salty. Otherwise- not bad.
698,"Liquor bar = a misnomer, but only kind of.

This place is a bar first and foremost: its selection of innovative cocktails spans pages upon pages whereas their food offerings span two. So, liquor bar it truly is, but amazing food it definitely has.

But: the bites are pretty killer, from what I experienced. For what they seemingly lack in a way of app and entree selection they more than make up for with the quality, care, and innovation of their offerings.

I landed after a long day of travel, famished. My lovely host, Brit S, picked me up from the airport, and after situating myself at the Conrad, we hopped the whole two blocks over to the Libertine.

(It should be noted that former Indy CM Jon A also highly suggested checking this place out.)

The space is long and lean, with a formidable bar set-up and bottles for days behind the bar. Bitters and fruit and tinctures and all that, you know the drill at this point. The ""kitchen"" is also behind the bar, and the whole thing is grey and low light and trees/antlers and candlelight and warm and really nice smells. It sort of reminded me of a less formal Hinterland (located in MKE). Employees rock the whole Stumptown coffee look, but they're not nearly as in yr face with it as Stumptown is.

Oh, yeah. I was telling a mildly entertaining story with linear progression, wasn't I? 

So: I was *famished,* and wanted nothing more than to start w/ one of their amazing cocktails, but knew I needed to put something in that stomach of mine first.

So... to the eats.

1. A beet salad starter which Brit and I shared. Goat cheese and spinach and beets and yup, you guessed it. So so good, as beet salads can be when they're done right. Then?

2. A chanterelle mushroom & fresh vegetable pot pie. Oh my god, I can't even. I love chanterelles, I love pot pies (secret favorite thing), so... you get the idea. Clearly handmade with fresh ingredients, I couldn't stop eating it. It was effing delicious. I was full, and yet, I kept eating. So so good.

The rest of the bites on the menu were on that whole gastro tip with an emphasis on the more foodie-focused. (God, I still hate the word foodie. I really do.) What I mean? I don't remember seeing offal or brains, but along those lines for sure. Marrow, elk, etc.

Anyways, moving on (and this is important). To the cocktail: our very attentive/sweet server and I talked through a myriad of offerings and possibilities, and after much ado about bourbon, we settled on a variation of Seelbach with a locally aged bourbon. It was absolutely perfect. Mmmm, Seelbach."
699,"Service is often hit or miss, but the tacos and drinks are both excellent. The best Mexican in St. Pete. Sit outside because the atmosphere is really nice. The bands that play usually aren't very good but overall it's a great place."
700,"For years, I have lamented about the lack of good cajun food in Philly. Thank you, Beck's, for filling this GAPING void. I think the first time I tried this place, it may have been in part because the line at Dinic's was unbearably long and the throngs of people waiting were spilling over into Beck's stall space (they are next to each other)... and boy am I glad my inner fatty couldn't wait another minute because I just don't know what I'd do without this jumbalaya! 

I will note that the service here is a bit terrible. Don't get me wrong - everyone is very nice, but ... SLOW-moving. VERY slow moving. I have never seen a more inefficient operation in my life, but like I said, they are super pleasant and helpful so you forgive them for taking 10+ minutes to pack  your order and collect payment (note: I've been there at least 4x and it's been true every single time). 

As an example of the employees' niceness/helpfulness, as an FYI, they do let you sample pretty much any of the entrees so you can make sure it's not too spicy or too peppery etc for you.

Also, no credit card machine here so bring CASH.

WHAT WE ATE
*Jumbalaya: perfect. perfect. AND it's surprisingly spicy! It's less saucy then some jumbalayas I have had, but still really flavorful and the rice is perfectly cooked. They also usually spoon on a bit of sauce on top and adds that extra flavor. IF you get the right cashier, she will upsell you the cornbread - GET IT - and eat it TOGETHER. They're not messing around when they say the cornbread + jumbalaya flavors complement each other like whoa.  

*Etouffee - the flavors of the bell peppers were a bit TOO strong for my personal liking, but I could appreciate the complexity of the flavors and the spiciness here as well. My friends really liked this dish, so I did want to mention. 

*Oyster Po'Boy - I thought the fried oyster was great. The breading they use to coat the po boy sandwich meats (and oysters) are really tasty and not overwhelming. I wish there was more oyster in the sandwich itself, but that would be the only complaint. 

*Beignets - warm and delightfully light fried dough and generous dusting of powdered sugar make this dessert just decadent enough. 

*Praline cookies - these were decent, but not the best I've ever had. The color was a bit darker than I was used to (more coffee with a splash of milk rather than latte color) and it almost tasted like they had burned/overcooked the butter or brown sugar. 

Beck's also has this authentic root beer from New Orleans available. I'm not a root beer fan so haven't tried, but I keep hearing awesome things about it."
701,"Yelp helped me find this place and the first tip they were on to something was that I was the only non-spanish person in the restaurant which was a great sign. I got the carne asada which was a huge steak with awesome baby spring onions and really nicely flavored rice and beans. Not your generic comes with everything dish, but really thoughtful, well flavored accompaniment. Definite thumbs up!"
702,"Great place to get out of the New Orleans heat. Great cold drinks, yummy appetizers and tasty Po'boys!"
703,Met a friend here tonight for a few drinks and food. I've never been here before and really liked it.  It has a nice rectangle bar and was lively and hopping on a Friday night.  Had a few glasses of wine and ordered the fish tacos and fries.  You get your choose of sides.  The fish tacos were spicy and absolutely delicious.  Three very hearty flakey fish tacos were served ( I'm thinking they were mahi) The women next to me had ordered the chicken  tenders dinner. It was huge.  So many enormous crispy breaded chicken pieces were served and she said they were absolutely delicious. She clearly had meals for the next several days.  I will definitely be back here.
704,Really great food. Love that it was a great spot for a family to eat breakfast. Banana pancakes and boudin omelet we're really good.
705,"One of my favorite spots in town. Burger is amazing, good vibe, nice staff. Go-to gastro pub for sure."
706,"This place was a great find. I'd say its a 4.5 but just because of the interior decor. The food was really good, that's a solid 5. We had a vegetable samosa, chicken tikka masala, onion kulcha & lamb rogan josh. Go expecting great indian food but not great decor. We were giggling on the paint job, very easy to tell it wasn't done by a professional. It sits right behind Nifty Fifties so it kind of gets lost & not seen well from Grant Ave but so worth the effort."
707,"MMMMMMMM.
The place is slowly starting to get more crowded, but I'm enjoying my slightly empty sunday dinners.  Really great service, the people there know their stuff and I've seen them guide people through picking a beer and food.
Their daily burger and grilled cheese specials are awesome and they've just added some new items like tortillas and salsa that are really good too. Brunch is rather new too.... but good! Love it here."
708,"I really like this place, and have had great talks with the owner.  One thing I've found is that the female baristas aren't very friendly to me, and I think I'm a pretty friendly guy.  Today (7/29/11) in particular was a bit annoying: I frequently order iced-tea here, and love that I get a free refill.  I was not aware that there was a charge for a refill on iced-coffee.  The baristas were rude to me and I felt like an imbecile after my interaction.  I'd appreciate the following:  1.) Before pouring me a refill, it would have been nice to let me know it ain't free. 2.) If I express surprise at their being a charge, please don't tell me I don't have to have it.  3.) If I choose to have it because I don't want it to go to waste, please don't tell me ""It's not very good iced coffee"". If it's ""not good"", why the hell should I have to pay for a refill when I don't have to pay for a refill of the iced-tea that is delicious?"
709,"This is a decent pizza place with a pizza bar around the pizza oven/hearth where you can see them make pizza right in front of you. 
The service is pretty quick. The only downside is that it is a small place and is always crowded so you should expect wait times."
710,"This is the home of my favorite burger anywhere! The West Coast is a riff on a double double from In-N-Out, but really it is what the double double dreams of becoming when it dies and goes to heaven! I like the Lenox Village location better than the Gulch, but the beer selection and West Coast with tots will keep me coming back for a long time. If you are gonna have 1 burger in Nashville you need to hit this place up. If you are gonna have 2 you need to then go to Gabbys."
711,"I came here to eat after moving my boyfriend into his apartment. I love the interior and the vibe was friendly and active. Lots of people at 11 pm on a Saturday night, although they came in waves. I was afraid their kitchen would be closed but I'm so glad it wasn't! I ordered the beef sandwich and it came in a reasonable amount of time. The sandwich was a respectable size and quite delicious. Their fries are to die for!!! Shoestring with just the right texture and amount of salt. 
My bf and his family were drinking, and I was impressed with how friendly the bar staff was. They were more than happy to explain to us their beer selection and gave us samples often! They were always attentive, despite the busy hour, and our drinks were quickly replenished. I would gladly come here again."
712,"We took a group of boys for a birthday party dinner and had a great experience. The waiter was really patient and helpful and easily handled our energetic group. 
The food was delicious - although since it was our first time at Brixx, we were a little sure posed by the small size of each pie. The taste made up for it, though. We'll definitely be back!"
713,"If you go make sure you order something with the carmelized bacon, it's wonderful.
The shrimp salad sandwich was very good as was the BLT. The brunch items looked good and the service was attentive. 
It's BYO and there is plenty of parking in the Spread Eagle Village lot. Would absolutely go back for lunch or brunch. 
Will try it for dinner in the future and report back."
714,"Love this spot! I've been here twice now, trying different dishes each time, and the food is consistently very good. 

Food: get the fried chicken. Also, get the Mac and cheese. You can feel guilty about it later. 

Atmosphere: cute and cozy with I've music. Just be warned that sitting near the musician means you won't be able to hear much of anything else. 

Service: always prompt and courteous!"
715,"I never waited longer than 10 mins for pho. but dam, it was worth the wait! I've been to so many pho restaurants... but the broth on this pho was amazing. the proportion was good too. the vietnamese sandwiches were good, but if you don't state what you want on it, they'll put everything on it...including peppers. The boba tea was good and the service was decent. The ambiance and decor of this place is legit. The only issue witht his place is that it's pretty small and parking kinda sucks, and your food may take long to receive after ordering. But like i said, the pho was bomb.com! found my new pho spot in the area!"
716,I moved in this area around October of last year and I had not stopped at this location of Angelos pizza until today. I will definitely be returning as I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and I saw their pizza that looked really scrumptious. This is run by real Italians and I will be back. The food was Magnifico
717,"Went here for the first time a few weeks ago on my birthday. The restaurant itself is in a fantastic location in the gulch. It was graduation weekend for Vanderbilt so it was a little crazy/busy for the staff, but the good was excellent. We had the steak and lamb for the entrees in addition to the grit soufflé and foie gras for appetizers. The grit soufflé was absolutely amazing (we were able to order without the bacon jelly - huge plus for non pork eaters out there). Both the lamb and the filet were excellent and extremely well prepared. They even bring out a bread basket beforehand which had a great selection. I can't comment on the wine as we brought a bottle with us- but other people looked happy with their drink selections. All in all would definitely go back, but it may be a good idea to not go during a super busy weekend like graduation (common sense on our part- just had to subtract a star because staff was preoccupied with larger family tables nearby)."
718,My bowl was so delicious. It was so filling even with it being the small bowl. All of the fruit was fresh and it was music to my mouth
719,Cheu is awesome. The brisket matzo ball pho is unreal and the buns are phenomenal. Go here now.
720,"Gray Brothers has been in Mooresville for 10,000 years serving up tasty cafeteria style food on clean white plates to Hoosiers and their guests from around the country. Old school ladies in orthopaedic shoes, brown aprons and hair nets will ladle out homestyle sides (mashed potatoes, corn or green beans) next to comfort food main dishes (meatloaf, fried chicken or baked fish) from behind steamy sneeze guards as you make your way down the buffet line which is approximately three miles long. It's a little known secret that there's an old timey dry goods store just behind the coat rack in the main lobby where one can stock up on provisions or barter pelts with real Mooresville natives. In the winter, children can use the yellow 6x4 foot cafeteria tray to go sledding down hills behind the Kroger across the street. 

Oh, you're not goin anywhere without pie! Tis a fact that one can legally marry a pecan pie or peach cobbler on the other side of the bridge just south of Gray Brothers Cafeteria."
721,"Excellent time here. Went late right before closing, 9:30, and the place was empty. The amazing waitress, Courtney ( I think ),  was very accommodating and even had the the cook take the heads off the shrimp at my request because it was slow. I really appreciated the hospitality here. Overall I would go again and get the boiling house sauce."
722,"I REALLY enjoy the food here.

Pros:
1) lots of seating and spacious - you're never scrunched up against other people
2) outdoor seating
3) food is FABULOUS
4) TONS of variety of food and drinks (e.g., more than 15 varieties of hot tea, four varieties of iced tea)
5) discounts if you bring in your own cup as well as a punch card to earn free stuff
6) free wifi
7) seasonal foods as well - including a great blueberry season (O.M.G.!!)
8) clean and well stocked
9) lots of parking - always able to find a spot (and right next to a FedEx)
10) locally/family owned - gotta love and support that

Cons:
1) with so much seating they need to invest in some sound dampening materials.  It is SO LOUD when there are many people there.  And when there aren't - you feel like other people can hear you.  I never feel like that at Bread Co. - busy or not.
2) the prices are a little high.  Not a lot.  Just a little too high.

That's it.  I love going to the Daily Bread.  I love how lovely they staff are.  They're very helpful and patient.  I try to meet with people here as often as possible.  My kids love it and we have never had a bad menu item."
723,Good Chinatown Flavor in South Philly. I usually get the Wonton Noodle Soup here that is comparable to Chinatown Restaurants. Clean Friendly Atmosphere. If you don't want to deal with the traffic downtown I suggest stopping by here.
724,I have been here several times over the past 6 months. The food is very good and so is the service
725,"We came for a Sunday brunch, and the place is amazing. We wanted to get a tour of the distillery, usually if the Brewster is there, they would totally do it, but because it was his day off, and the restaurant was busy, we didn't get a chance to do the tour. However, the manager was extremely kind, he offered to tour us when rush hour is over, we just couldn't really wait around. You can peak at the distiller through the bar though!

Really like their drinkware!

I had the bone marrow plate, and it was very good. Came with crispy toast. Other snack that looked interesting including the duck plate.

The brunch menu wasn't too interesting, but overall the food quality is good.

Nice beer and cocktail menu!"
726,"We stopped into this restaurant due to its convenience to our tour bus pickup across the street.  The seating area was fairly large, including extra space upstairs (where we were).  This was great, because we only had to wait a couple minutes for a table.  We enjoyed the char-grilled oyster appetizer, but I thought it was missing ""something"".  Maybe a bit of pepper or other seasoning...

I wasn't terribly hungry, so I just ordered a cup of gumbo.  It was decent but only had chicken and sausage inside, and I really thought it could use a bit of seafood to round out the flavor.  The kids liked their food off the kids menu pretty well, although they should offer a marinara sauce option for the noodles (my young daughter wasn't so excited about butter sauce on her noodles).  My wife had enjoyed what she ordered, although I can't remember what she ordered for the life of me!

This wouldn't be our first choice for New Orleans cuisine in the whole city, but it's a good short notice option."
727,Ordered a giant plate of biscuits and gravy with chorizo on top and the food is delicious! I recommend this place to anyone!
728,"Let me start by saying, this is OTB, not the Chez Jene. As far as a bar / restaurant goes, this place is nice, and a major upgrade to the old location in Claypool Courts.

The bar / restaurant area was modern and clean. The staff were friendly and helpful. The prices were reasonable, considering the part of downtown, and that you are at an off track betting facility.

Now for the OTB part, this was a separate area from the bar, separated by two large frosted glass doors. The betting areas are all non smoking, which is great. No one wants to breath the crap that blew out of lungs of one of these peeps.  There is a smoking area for the people  who want to step out for a smoke.

Excellent selection of local craft beers, a major upgrade from the last OTB location.

I will return to lose more money in the future. This is a nice place for OTB!"
729,"I came in for happy hour 4-7pm, I ordered the lobster-shrimp tacos & the 50 cent Louisiana Oysters. The Louisiana Oysters surprisingly were pretty large in size & they tasted really fresh. It was great service, the waiters were all very attentive. Unfortunately, they did not have the fresh fruit tart desert, so I was extremely disappointed that there were no other good options for desert."
730,"Easy online ordering. Food was good. We had a cheesesteak with fried onions, mozzarella sticks, onion rings, and a pizza steak.

One thing I didn't like was that the cheese steak automatically comes with sauce. It doesn't mention this on the menu so I didn't know to order it without sauce."
731,"Tried it for the first time today. Only a few blocks from my house and I had no clue this delicious place existed. Service was great and the food didn't taste greasy at all. I wish their vegetarian selection was a little more varied but their veggie omelette, the California sammich, and house potatoes were yum!!! They make their bread and pastries in house."
732,"Fireside Pizza is located in the ""historical"" downtown part of Palm Harbor..it is another of a new breed of restaurant that I have noticed is starting to pop up around the state in that it's a high end wood fired Pizzeria that also serves high end beer and wine..this is definitely one of the better ones I have been to...first the beer menu is fantastic...whomever is choosing it knows their beer...lots of great ""national"" craft beers from Founders..Stone..etc, but than many stellar local ones from the likes of Cigar City ..7th Sun..etc...as for the food, everything I have had so far has been great...salads are done well....the hot wings are cooked in the pizza oven and served with crunchy onions on them..these are worth the trip here alone...the pizzas have all been good as well..the wood oven gives the thin crust a crunchy snap that is tough to match...pepperoni and sausage version has received high praise, but my personal favorite is one of their specialty Pizzas, the Parma, which has prosciutto and arugula on it..just fabulous..if I was just rating on the beer and food this place is a 5 star all the way...the only problems I have with Fireside are it's pretty small inside and outside on the patio so there is not much seating, so as you can imagine the wait times can be pretty long on a lot of nights...even calling in takeout orders we have been quoted one hour plus pick-up times ,obviously due to the fact they are crowded and the brick oven can only hold so many pizzas at once...the crowds and the fact that the servers here always seem to be in a grumpy mood(maybe due to always being busy) makes me have to deduct a star...well that and the fact that last time we were there the utter chaos in the parking lot at the Redneck Bar across Nebraska had all of us Diners on the patio at Fireside hoping we were not going to end up as collateral damage from the rapidly escalating conflict!!.... Fireside is definitely a recommended spot if you like high end Pizza and Craft Beer and don't mind paying a little more for such high quality fare..just try to go at an ""off"" hour and watch the parking lot across the street to make sure ""All's Quiet on the Western Front"" and you will have a great meal and time"
733,"It was delicious! A great location and I loved the atmosphere. Also, both the host and server were very nice."
734,"Spanish food and The Hill don't go together...right?  WRONG.  Whenever anyone asks me what is my favorite restaurant on the Hill, I always say:  Modesto.  For one reason and one reason alone:  olive tapenade.  Yes, I am secure enough in my own sexuality to say ""Olive Tapenade.""  That stuff just keeps me coming back every time.  
I really can't top Aimee K's review - I have tried and liked all of the food dishes she mentioned.  The baked goat cheese is one of my favorite dishes ever.  Anywhere.  So good.  I know they also have half price wine night on Wednesday's (I think)... another reason to go visit this gem of a secret on the Hill.  They always have very unique specialty cocktails and sangrias.  
This is a great date spot or a spot to go eat with friends."
735,"Love the revised interior very much NWO style/Parisian bistro style. It is cozy.  Conversation & cocktails were enjoyable versus TVs and sports.  Service was friendly and prompt.  Drinks, we tried several of the house cocktails of Sazarac's (repeated numerous times) & Joe Christmas were very solid.  Kudos to the mixologist - not everyone can consistently craft cocktails - at least in my extensive research.
Also various local draft beers were tried and a Bordeaux for good measure.
Apps of blackened shrimp and hominy hush puppies were tasty.  Dinner ranged from Blackened Red Fish Po'Boy served w/ Cajun chips, crab stuffed Missouri catfish to Shrimp & Grits. All were pleased with our choices and nothing remained once we were done. Dessert of Whiskey Caramel baked Alaska was shared.  All three of us agreed L'Acadiane hit all the marks on our list of solid cocktails, local beers, good wine; delectable food, great service and atmosphere that makes you want to linger."
736,"Staying at the Sheraton at University City, and was looking for a place that was easy to walk and fairly close.  Tried Han Dynasty last night partly because it was recommended by the hotel as well as a couple that was in the elevator.

Interesting that there were three noodle shops with 2 or 3 city blocks.  I really enjoyed the appetizers (dumplings in chili oil) and the entree (garlic chicken).  I know, I know, I was looking for noodles and ended up without.  I think this was mostly because as I was looking at the menu, plates kept going by me, steaming of fresh, Chinese wok flavors. I couldn't resist but to try a little of this and a little of that.

Meal was hot, fresh, flavorful and an excellent recommendation.

On a down side, as I have noticed on this trip, the customer service, servers, waiters don't seem too excited to be working.  They seem tired, uninterested and could care less of your/my experience.  Maybe this is normal in Philly?"
737,Delicious breakfasts in laid back environment.  Egg nog pancakes with a rum syrup were awesome.
738,"Aside from the staff being super friendly, the food is quite tasty and the environment is super chill yet a little hectic at the same time but it somehow works. 

What I appreciated the most about Milktooth, is you can really tell the food is made with good quality ingredients. I definitely had my heart set on the Sweet Tea Chicken Fried Biscuit and was a little bummed to hear they were sold out. However, the little bear plate was simple, yet delicious and paired nicely with a side of savory whey grits. Also, the slow drip coffee is on point .

Overall, Milktooth is a great addition to the Fletcher Place/Fountain Square area. I'm looking forward to spending many weekends at this place."
739,"Redfish Fajitas, Ceviche, Chicken & Shrimp Fajitas  Were all really good. Small Restaurant with tight seating (does have outside seating as well) and not much parking.  Food was all fresh and delicious. Only problem was we had a new waiter who didn't know the ropes yet...so we received our appetizer at the same time as our main course. Well actually actually we never received the Queso dip..because waiter didn't know he was supposed to go fix that himself...yikes! Refill on drinks were slow coming as well.  But overall the fresh well prepared food means we will try it again.:)"
740,"Met friends there for brunch on a Sunday. Boer fact day to chill on their expansive patio with some refreshing margaritas.  Staff was friendly and professional.  The atmosphere has a nice cool vibe to it.  Definitely a great addition to the Tampa food scene for an upscale Mexican restaurant.   Table side guacamole was well prepared, and came paired up with gluten free tortilla chips.  The added hot sauce was HOT.  I eat a lot of spice but this definitely brings the kick.   Food was generally good. Not outstanding but tasty and fresh. I had the carne Asada  tacos.  Definitely would revisit"
741,"Desserts and Ambience... Crowds vary by the time and day you go, but quiet or crowded, it's an interesting ""bistro"" type place. You can't miss with this spot as a date night locale - always delicious, and cozy. The menu has changed very little over time, and it's not overly extensive, but they often have a new ""special dessert"" or special of the day. Be warned as their favorites do run out, so the later in the day you go, items may not be available. Their carrot cake is pretty good, moist and not too sweet. Located close to local schools and Webster University, this is often a place to go to escape those ""regular"" establishments. #AsianLadyLikes"
742,"Amber is all about expectations. If you're looking for the best americanized Punjabi food in Indy, this is it. If you want authentic and more varied food, look elsewhere (I'd point you at Sizzling India on north Allisonville). Service and decor are nothing special but, in comparison to other other Indian restaurants that often offer Indian levels of service, Amber is above average."
743,"I had the traditional breakfast (two eggs, bacon, toast, and fruit) and split the french toast with friends. It was good. I have to say my favorite part was their English Breakfast Tea made with a french press and fresh honey. Delicious. It's slightly on the pricey side but you are in Santa Barbara in the touristy section."
744,"This review isn't based on an overnight stay at Matrix Hotel, but based on attending various conferences at the hotel.  I like the open lobby with lots of seating when you first walk in which is great for a quiet area to make a quick phone call or to wait for someone.  Closed to the front desk, there's a small display indicating what events are taking place in what ballroom.

Upon heading up the stairs, there's a hallway to the left or right leading to the rooms.  I have attended events in the rooms to the right.  The layout is great to allow for registration tables to be set up and the washrooms are close by.  The washrooms are nice and then have comfortable hand towels and the soap well stocked

The room was set up with tables and chairs and a podium and table at the front.  It's great there's a large screen for a PowerPoint presentation as well.  For the event, there was light food and beverages at the back of the room.  The staff were working hard to make sure the cups and plates were promptly removed and ensuring there was no shortage for people to use.

On a warm day, the temperate in the room was cool but comfortable.  The details were taken care of and made for a comfortable and great event.  Thanks Matrix for always being a great venue for an event!"
745,"Came here from out of town for a graduation dinner and the staff was very accommodating to hold a cake in the back for us to surprise the graduate which was very nice. There was a group of 10-15 of us and the restaurant was spaced out well to where we did not feel crowded. We started off with the chicken 65, veg pakora, and shrimp Manchurian. All came out with good timing, hot, and fresh. The chicken was quite juicy and had the right amount of heat, the shrimp were plump and buttery, and the veg pakora were crispy and did not have that super oily taste that they sometimes can have. We ordered the lamb tikka masala and the tandoori chicken for our entree and I will have to say the lamb melted in our mouth. There was no gamey taste yet it definitely still had a nice lamb flavor to it which was accompanied well by the gravy. The tandoori chicken was good but I would not say anything special- it was lacking in the umami department although it was a nice pieces of meat. We ordered everything medium and it had the perfect amount of heat ( I would say we like heat but not anything that is going to make us sweat). I probably wouldn't visit here again since I am coming in from out of town but if I lived near by I am sure it would be one of my indian food take out spots."
746,"This was the only BBQ I had while in Tennessee and it was great!

I had the beef brisket, with a side of potato salad and Mac & cheese. The BBQ sauce was sweet and exactly what I enjoy. I wasn't extremely impressed with the sides, I thought the mac could have been better!

I was bummed that the fried okra wasn't in season, but will return on my next visit to Nashville to try it out!

This was my first bushwhacker experience and I loved it! It's this crazy boozy frozen drink- think boozy chocolate milkshake but better."
747,We arrived a bit later and were seated outside right away. The waitress recommended the local lobster and it was delicious! Great atmosphere looking out over the water.
748,"I live in the area and am thrilled ot have live music 5 nights/week.  We have eaten here for both brunch and dinner--both were very good, not standard bar fare at all.  They are reaching for gastropub and some of the menu hits it squarely,.  The Onion Tart and Vegetarian Shephard's Pie, for instance.  Wonderful vibe inside.  And did we mention the live music...a juke joint on Headhouse Square...c'mon people, you gotta love THAT."
749,Got the cheese steak pizza. It was very good and came out quickly. Service is you order at the counter and pickup when ready. No need for tipping. I would recommend as the selection is well rounded and you can't beat all organic for a good price.
750,"I love milk and honey! Big sign right in front. Walking inside to see some great designing. The store build out is very clean and great attention to detail. The menu ranges from brunch items to cold pressed juices. We got the fried chicken biscuit and the mean & green juice. It was really good the biscuit nice and fluffy. Chicken juicy and crispy. The juice was lightly sweet. I would definitely recommend this spot for brunch. 

Recommendation: fried chicken biscuit / mean & green cold press juice"
751,"I ate here with my colleagues after a long day of meetings and we certainly enjoyed the very good food, and even attentive service. I had their gulf fish mahi mahi as an entree and mashed sweet potato as side. Excellent! I finished with the sorbet sampler and that was just right, not too much! I would recommend coming here and then going upstairs to check out their balcony facing Jackson Square."
752,"I had a lemon corn cake for lunch and it was delicious. I didn't realize I was basically ordering dessert for lunch, but I don't regret it. The service was good too! I would be happy to return."
753,"One of my favorite restaurants in port Richmond/fishtown... Food is always good and service is excellent. The owner Frank is a very good guy and so friendly!! It's a small BYOB which I always love. I have been going there since they opened I believe it's about 2 or 3 years now!! From girls nights to dinner dates, I always pick to go there!!!"
754,"My parents and I were looking for a quick meal of Ukrainian food and thought to check out Uncle Ed's.  I hadn't been here in years.

My mother's tomato soup and ham sandwich were delicious, the sauerkraut perogies and cabbage rolls were very good.  Dad and I are very happy.

Our waitress was very pleasant.  The service was fast and the price is fantastic!"
755,"The chicken chow mein is what the kids love. The sesame chicken is light, crispy and good for the whole family. We took 3 kids had sesame chicken, beef with broccoli, chicken chow mein and steamed rice. We left with 2 to go boxes so the portions are good sized. The whole meal with tea and soft drinks was under $40. It was a very early dinner so it was not at all crowded. We will definitely be back."
756,"Excellent spicy Szechuan food.  I have enjoyed everything I've had here.  Service can be a little slow for lunchtime, but the food makes up for it.  If you don't want MSG in your food (I don't), make sure to ask for no-MSG.  I consider MSG to be cheating and I expected better from them.  I honestly think the food tastes just as good without it."
757,"I spent a great birthday happy hour here with the usual suspects last week. Our server was attentive, fast, and funny (albeit non-intentionally). The martinis were fantastic and the oysters were fresh, fresh, fresh! But...take it to the bridge!

Pros:

Service - wonderful
Bar options - excellent
No waiting!
Oysters on the 1/2 shell? Tasty, tasty, with no BP aftertaste.

Cons:

The shucker removed perhaps 4 out of 12 of the oysters from their shell. Not the seamless experience I wanted, and it stopped me from ordering an additional dozen. I was also surprised there wasn't a different type of dipping sauce, like a mignonette offered. I'm happy to make my own cocktail sauce, but I was surprised...
The gumbo? For me, it was odd - all roux, with not much seafood, chicken or sausage. And, rice seemed like a practice batch of risotto was used - it was gummy and crunchy.

I'm ready to go back and get more oysters, but maybe with a different shucker working...."
758,"Love this place for 3 reasons:

Delicious food:
-Highly recommend the beer battered green beans and the pub burger with tomato jam. They cook the burger perfectly!!

Diverse drink menu:
-Beers are always awesome, and there is enough to choose from. But I wanna talk about the Bloody Mary... ohhhhhhh... SO good!!! I live so close to this place, and I'm usually there on Sundays recovering my hangover with a TASTY bloody mary!! GET IT!

The staff:
-One word: Hipster. But of course the cool ones. Always super friendly and assist you right away. 

PS. You don't even have to ask for a glass of water. They will bring it to you. classy!"
759,"If you miss the vietnamese restaurant Pho Tau Bay, this one comes pretty close in terms of overall experience.  Granted, I've only had the Pho here at Le and haven't tried any of the Bun or Bahn Mi.  But I really really enjoyed my Pho Tai.  The serving size of the soup was generous and packed with noodles.  The herbs were fresh and served in perfect amounts on a nice serving tray.  The meat was also fresh; it was eye of round  that was rare initially upon serving but immediately cooked to done when stirred into the soup.  The beef broth was crystal clear and had a nice, clean flavor.  Overall, I would call the experience of the Pho just about perfect.
The atmosphere and service were pleasant.  It lies somewhere between the lunch counter type vietnamese places, and the ones that are more refined and Americanized.
Overall a joyful experience and I will definitely be back!"
760,Fresh food and creative dishes. The service was good and the seating was comfortable. The orange juice is awesome. I was very pleased with the made to order hash.
761,"No less than five people, from the busboy to the owner behind the counter, wished us a friendly 'goodnight' on our way out. That NEVER happens! 
Great Italian classic meals at good prices. 
Not fancy. (There is a small TV in the dining room) but caters to families with children, small parties and everything in between. Not a quiet, romantic meal, but a tasty one."
762,"LOVE Mi Ranchito! We come here often for lunch.
The restaurant is huge, but it does fill up! Recommend arriving by 11:30 on a weekday to not have a wait. If you do have a wait, it won't be long--they turn tables quickly.

Everything I've tried here is great. Some favorites are the fajita nachos, chimichangas, and Lunch Vippy's Special (A chicken burrito topped with queso, and rice on the side). 
The best part about Mi Ranchito in my opinion... always consistent! Food is always delicious, and hot! The service is quick as well. All of the staff are friendly."
763,It's old school food where the locals eat...That's always a good sign plus it's been open forever so I am pretty sure that means they are doing something right. Make sure you are hungry when you come here because they aint scared to fill the plate with plenty of food. Had the seafood plater and WOW they piled on the fried goods!!! The service is quick and prices are very reasonable. Will go back when I am in town again. Remember it's not diet food.
764,"Cool place! Cute little wine bar in a retro filling station in a residential neighborhood near the Botanical Garden.  The waitress was very knowledgeable about wines and the manager came over and introduced himself and talked to us for awhile. I went with two other friends and we also ordered some light food.  I had a Turkish pizza which was incredible. Nice relaxing atmosphere. We sat inside as it was a little muggy, but the outdoor patio was open where they were showing some silent black and white movie. We also took a tour of the basement where the wine cellar and a  private tasting room are. And if you go up the stairs, there is a restaurant, which I believe is in a former apartment, Elaia, which may be a future trip. I will return to Olio and also want to check out the pastry shop across the street, Choquette, which was closed that night. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it's small and kind of cramped, and I can imagine if we had gone there at a busy time, there would have been nowhere to sit."
765,"Awesome po-boy selection. Ifyou want to sample, they have a great Louisiana sampler as well"
766,"Amazing presentation of food, staff and atmosphere!  Jamie, our waiter, was great!  Extremely helpful, fast and attentive.  Don't miss out this hidden gem."
767,"A great option in the French Quarter for good food and service.  Everyone was happy with their meal and the well-priced wine.  Only flaw was the terrible dry reheated bread with the over salted butter, skip that to save room for the meal, which, like everything in New Orleans, is not light.  Not the classic New Orleans dishes for the most part but brings in the flavors.  I had the crab cake and the red fish, both delicious."
768,"Surprisingly good authentic Taiwanese food in Reno. 

This place is tiny and packed with people waiting for tables. If crowds or people hovering over you while dining makes you feel uncomfy, this likely isn't the place for you.  Tables do turn pretty quickly. 

Boba drink was meh - syrup used and not mixed. Be sure to shake it well before stabbing in a straw. 

Food was great though. We had:
Beef noodle soup - A+
Garlic/basil chicken - A+
Beef chow fun - B+
Pork filled pancakes - B (wished the pancake was more crispy)
Tofu and bak choi - B"
769,"First we shared a Blossom Onion (delicious ). Then we had rib eye steaks and they were cooked to perfection and had a great taste. 
We went on a Sunday about 2:00pm and were seated right away and service was OK. The waitress took our order in a timely manner but never came back to check on us to see if we needed anything until we asked for the bill.
They have a Early Bird menu for $8.99 until 3:00pm but we wanted the Ribeye's ( not on the Early Bird Menu ) 
Will go back again."
770,"Yolk had the hustle and bustle that you would expect from a brunch place on a Sunday morning. The wait wasn't terribly long and we were seated relatively quickly. They have a wide variety of things on their menu that good. My favorite thing about the menu was that you could substitute a normal side for one of their sweet specialities for only $3! So I was able to get an omelet, a side of grits, and I upgraded to banana bread French toast. Overall, the food was good but it wasn't amazing. The French toast and grits were my favorite thing about the meal....for some reason the omelet just didn't do it for me. I would go back and try a few other things off the menu but I don't think it makes my list of top brunch places in Indy"
771,"Really great made to order pizza, like a Chipotle for pizza! I had the alligator sausage with pepperoni, onions, mushrooms and jalapeños on mine and it was delicious! Great beer and smores pie too (use the Yelp offer for the smores pie)! Some issues with charging for this free pie but otherwise great service too!"
772,"My girlfriend and I went to Edley's Bar-B-Que Today, 8/28/13, and it was phenomenal! It was a little crowded, but we didn't have to wait five minutes for a table. The restaurant is set up kind of like a high end fast food joint (although the food is MUCH better than your McDonalds.) You go to an order line in the front of the restaurant, place your order, and the food is then delivered to your table. The orders are each designated a number. Ours was 31. 

Overall, Edley's was great! the quality of food and service was superb. Not to mention, their bar-b-que sauce was unreal. I would highly recommend Edley's."
773,"Solid, but nothing ground breaking or innovative. People dress business casual, or so it seemed when we went. No need to stress too hard about it though. There was a wait, even though we had reserved and there was lot of space in the back. Very good Liver Pâté with the assorted cheeses and such. Dessert was lackluster. Overall, more in the positive than the negative"
774,"Really, really good food here. Had reservations for 10, at 9:30 on a Saturday night.   The place was still busy & filled up, but we were seated within a few minutes.  No problem at all...just grabbed a Victory Brew from the bar while we waited. Now that's a beer that get's better every single time I have it...(or, maybe I'm just developing a resistance to the bitterness that I remember from college???). Anyway, it went down mighty easily, and over the years, I've learned the hard way that drinking too many of them will instill upon you in the next day some of the worst feelings known to man.  Awh, heck...as they say ""Victory Comes at a Price"" :)

So there I was, thinking that we would be the only idiots eating dinner that late, but...this is West Chester, on a Saturday night...(I was wrong)! The place was crowded and loud, but nothing that would draw you away.   A very nice waitress seated us in the back at a large round table, and we had drinks & menus in no time at all.  These people were working towards the end of what was likely a very long & hectic shift, but they still managed to seem like they were enjoying being there. Very polite, and easy smiles. As I've learned from sisters & friends once in that line of work....being fake is what waitress do very well!     Anyway, there are good reasons this place was so busy. The menu is large, the atmosphere was pleasant, the food was delicious, and I'll definitely go back there again...maybe on a weeknight that's hopefully less crowded.  Not too pricey either, considering where & what it is.  Two thumbs up!"
775,"I've been here several times. The price is reasonable, food is quite good, and the service as well. I've always ordered take-out. One time I went, and the guy who normally takes my order wasn't there... Instead there were 2 ladies... I think one was the wife of the owner. Or something along those lines. Anyway they were nice but when I came back to pick up my order they handed me the wrong bag (someone else's order). They should have confirmed the contents, but frankly I should have as well, so I accept at least part of the blame. I ended up going all the way home before I realized the screw-up and came back. I wasn't angry but I was definitely hungry and super-annoyed. The two ladies were gracious and apologetic, and they even threw in a courtesy snack for my trouble."
776,"The line can be intimidating, but moves pretty fast. The pancakes are the bomb. I love pancakes I thought it was worth it. I went on a busy Saturday and my group of 5 waited in line, sat down and finished our food in maybe less than 2 hours, probably less than that. The coffee wasn't great, but lets be honest I was there for the chocolate chip pancakes."
777,"Once, my salad had dirt in it. Seriously.

It was like it was plucked from the ground that very moment and didn't get a bath.

Oh well. I ordered the Kogut's Curry - roasted chicken, melted Swiss and cheddar with curried mayonnaise on Russian black bread. It was mighty greasy, but mighty tasty too, and if there was dirt in it, it blended in with the bread.

I've since been here for their farmer dinners, where a local farmer sources the produce/meat/cheese and they create a special meal around the ingredients. It was lovely. Eggplant stuffed with goat cheese and tomatoes and sauteed summer squash from Biver Farms.

I've obviously gotten over my dirt phobia. Just proves the food here is farm fresh. I'm pulling for the clean, farm fresh approach, though."
778,"I wish there was more seating but what're you gonna do! Haha

Friendly staff, and huge portions.

So yummy! Love the scrambles and burritos. The French toast was amazing for real too!"
779,Great little authentic Italian restaurant. We eat there regularly never had a bad meal.  Gets really crowded on weekends so make reservations.  It's byob which is really nice.
780,"I enjoyed Grand Isle so much that I came back twice during my one week stay in New Orleans!  Highly recommend sitting right up at the bar so you can watch the oysters being shucked - very cool!

Trip One:
It was my first night in New Orleans and I was starving!  I went on Yelp to see what was around my hotel and noticed that Harrah's casino was right across the street.  Having been the Harrah's in Atlantic City several times (more times than I'd like to admit), I knew that there had to be good restaurants associated with the casino.  I strolled into Grand Isle around 7pm on a Tuesday night, and thankfully it wasn't busy.  I took a seat at the bar and ordered my first local beer - the Nola Blonde.  For an appetizer, I ordered the shrimp gumbo - how touristy of me!  It was really good!  Everything shrimp gumbo should taste like.  For dinner, I decided on the house made gator sausage po boy.  OH MY GOD amazing!  The flavors worked so well together and the gator sausage was delicious.  I knew instantly that I'd be getting this again before I headed back to PA.

I'm not sure if martinis were on special that night, but I saw a ton of them being ordered.  The ladies next to me got louder and more hilarious as the night went on, so I'm assuming the martinis were pretty good haha.

Trip Two (two days after trip one):
My boyfriend arrived in New Orleans and I told him I had to take him to a few, great restaurants I had tried earlier in the week.  We headed over to Grand Isle!  For an appetizer, we got the Isle Sampler of oysters.  All of them were delicious, but the oysters fulton (with bacon, cheddar, and onions) was my favorite.  So good!  For entrees, I once again ordered the gator sausage po boy and my boyfriend got the shrimp caminada po boy (which had apparently won an award at the po boy festival in the past year or two).  You've already read my review about the gator po boy, so let me tell you about the shrimp caminada:  IT WAS DELICIOUS.  Asian herb slaw was amazing and the shrimp was plentiful.  I can see why this won awards.

We spoke with the bartender a little bit, who was a super nice guy.  Turns out he's from NJ, so it was nice to run into someone from our homeland.

In short:  Go to Grand Isle.  Get some oysters, shrimp caminada po boy, the gator po boy, and a lot of beer (and maybe some martinis? haha).  You won't be disappointed!"
781,Fruit + cheese + bread + protein = awesome sandwich. Chatham knows how to combine and meld yummy items together. All of their sandwiches are awesome. And they make their own Bloody Mary mix... Great Sunday lunch. Or great anytime. It gets a bit packed but worth the wait.
782,"Haven't eaten the food here - just stopped by for the bar.

I showed up here at around 1am on Saturday for a friend's birthday, and had a damn good time. The bartender was great - I ordered a long island and she warned me that they are huge and $13. When I told her I didn't want to spend that much, she wasn't offended and actually made me a modified drink with 151 that cost $8 but packed the punch of a long island. There was a $10 minimum for credit cards so the bartender gave me a beer in addition, which I gave to a friend. The tab came to $10 even - the beer was just $2 - and I was a very happy camper as I slurped down my drink.

The music was great, and I loved the tiny dance floor - it was packed and everybody was having a great time. I would come back here again for the very strong drinks and fun dancing (and I don't dance...)"
783,"I really liked this place.  I went with a coworker during beer week.  We came from their sister bar Farmer's Cabinet.  Both places are quite similar, but FC had an air of pretentiousness that Boilermaker didn't.  FC was also considerably more expensive for smaller portions whereas Boilermaker's beers and food were reasonably-priced.

Their beer week offerings featured over a dozen from their brewery, Cabinet Artisinal Brewhouse which are mainly sour and/or really interesting beers.  I absolutely loved everything I tried.  One of the two bartenders was very knowledgeable and all were helpful.  We ordered their hot dog plate which was 2 bacon-wrapped hot dogs with a mountain of fries for $9 which is a pretty good deal IMO.

Unfortunately, I just read that the headbrewer is leaving Cabinet Artisinal Brewhouse.  Hopefully they can get another highly skilled brewer to continue pumping out unique brews (especially my beloved sours) as their beers were a big reason I'd go back to this place."
784,"We ventured over here on Friday at noon and the wait was about 30 minutes. Luckily the line moves fast and they provide self-serve complimentary coffee outside. I thought that was a nice little touch.
Everyone here is extremely friendly! Our waitress came over to our table right when we were seated and made some delicious recommendations. Since we were starving and standing in line, we already knew exactly what we wanted. I ordered the raspberry delight, which was basically three rolled up pancakes with raspberry, powdered sugar and whipped cream. Wow and add that maple syrup to it, everything about those pancakes was perfect. It was hard to stop eating them!
Only disappointment was the bacon. It was barely crispy! I feel like it is hard to mess up bacon, especially at a breakfast joint, but they sure did and it was definitely not worth $4. Also, note that you pay at the counter once you're done."
785,"oh yeah...uummm hhhmmm....
Visited for the first time and had the Sunday supper. The shrimp and grits was off the chain..hummus was lovely, beans great. Was a tad bit disappointed by the mac and cheese tho, needed to be thicker and less runny"
786,"Dropped by for lunch after church because we were craving burgers.  Love the atmosphere and we got there before the rush.  Rustic wood and metal made the dining room feel warm and contemporary.  Music was hip and a few beards could be seen.  The bull horns over the bar and the abstract cow scene paintings felt like a ranch house.  We ordered the Black and Blue burger medium and the Salmon burger medium.  The salmon burger was visually and texturally perfect and a moist and tender medium but under seasoned.  The quality of the salmon was good and flavor was clean.  The Black and Blue burger was cooked perfectly and seasoned.  I like the buns, brioche style buttered and grilled so they are soft and crispy.  On a side note they served home made ketchup and Heinz so the kids have something familiar.  The home cut fries were great as usual and with the truffle oil made them perfect we also tried the special side which was a roasted red potato and grilled okra salad.  It had a mayonnaise base with seasoned salt sprinkled on top which was good but not my favorite.  I liked that the okra was left whole but may be better with the mayo seasoned with the seasoned salt.  

Over all I like Burger Up they are consistently good but wish they would season as they cook.  The staff are friendly and the restaurant including the restrooms are clean.  Jeremy was our server, he was there when we needed him and close by when we didn't a perfect balance that allowed us to enjoy our family lunch."
787,"Cincinnati's finest!  Skyline 3-Way chili, what could be better?  
They now have a hot and spicy cheese option that's was great."
788,"Ordered the Swiss Chocolate pancakes and they were very good, but the chocolate was a bit sweet for my taste even without syrup. I think if I had scraped off a bit of the chocolate I would've given this place 5 stars. Maybe next time I'll try something different."
789,"Soooo good! We went with a team of people and hand no clue what to get so our server suggested and brought us a mix of things, all so delicious. There was something for everyone. It was unique and classic and hearty all in one. The black spaghetti is a must try (don't remember the name!) Service was phenomenal! The location was super convenient too, the whole street was lively and inviting!"
790,"Top 10.. delicious food, great freindly service.. English Breakfast was perfect.Highly Recommended.. stay away from the""Pond"" go here instead"
791,"Pizza was good, many many options. Awesome Garlic Bread Ap. Salad was tasty and the desert (strawberries/ seasonal) is definitely worth ordering."
792,"After a beautiful autumn walk through the Botanical Gardens I stopped in for lunch. It is basically a old service station turned restaurant, but don't let that throw you off. Trust me - you will love this place. 

Think vintage oil cans and crystal decanters with silver trays and copper tagines. Add to the mix a variety of artisanal gin, rye and Japanese whiskey served over an upbeat but chill background music (Like ARE & BE on Spotify).

I ordered the Ugni blanc with some baba ganoush and the autumn root vegetable tagine. Homemade bread was amazing and everything was delicious. I'll let the photo do the talking.

I'll be back!"
793,"My date and I came here for dessert only and were really happy we stopped by. 

It was pretty late on a Saturday but the restaurant was very busy. Being new to the St. Louis area, I didn't know the Cyrano's reputation and was surprised when the waitress so causally asked if we were dining or in for dessert only. Lot's of restaurants balk at the idea of you coming in for only one item, but not Cyranos. 

We order the cherries jubilee and sat back and enjoyed the presentation and dessert . Would come back again to order from the main menu."
794,Always eat here when visiting Nashville. A great burger joint.... and the truffle fries are the bees knees! Sláinte!
795,"Place is cozy , good service and food is nice. My wife really likes to come here more because of the place than the food. Little bit pricey."
796,Good food and great service.  Enjoyable dining experience.
797,The Bricks is a tasty restaurant for lunch with a cool and unique Ybor City atmosphere along with friendly service! The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it is a little pricey for the quantities.
798,The best thing about this place is the plethora of appetizers available. Its great to order a few and share with your friends. They have a wide variety of better than average spirits and some good craft cocktails on the menu.
799,"Okay, it's really good. I mean really good. Whoever says it's an average cafeteria.... where are these other cafeterias? Show them to me so I can try them out!

The line is LONG. I mean there were 6 of us and we waited for about an hour, from doorway to trays. We were joking around so I felt the time passed quickly. I also thought the food was worth it.

I had the breaded pork tenderloin with whiite gravy, which was massive and just incredible. It is so not to eat something you know was just made. This is a reason to go somewhere this busy, the food is giong to be really fresh! Nice turn over. but I digress. The mac and cheese, who said it isn't real cheese? It obviously is and is obviosly homemade, perhaps you are lazy or don't know what a  cheese sauce it....  creamy and good. Mashed potatoes, they were good, everyone else raved. The gravy was good. I mean they aren't out of a box... I should have had teh fried ones. I had a chees cake with cherry topping, just great.

I will say two people had teh strawberry pir and although they gave high marks to the quality of teh strawberries and the real whipped cream (yes, not out of a can!) they thought the crust was meh.

Okay, excellent place and though we waited there was ample seating. My serious fear! 

If I lived here I would eat here, If I pass through again, I will eat here. I might tryo find out if there was a better time to get there. Is it this crowed from 11-8:30? OPerhaps people sleep on the pavement teh night before like for Star Wars movies...."
800,"1. Cultural
2. Filling portions
3. Don't judge by the storefront

Consumed: 
Lamb kabob
Fish kabob

Hole in the wall? Whatever. It's so good! This was my first time trying afghani food and it was a very pleasant experience. I really like the ambiance. The cultural decorations are pretty fun. The artwork is pretty, if you have an appreciation for that kind of stuff. This restaurant is like a mini museum! 

The food was descent. The fish was light and yummy. It was too dry. I used the spicy, tangy sauce to add a little more flavor. The lamb was also pretty decent. It was nicely flavored and the gamey taste was subtle. 

GOOD EXPERIENCE!"
801,"I just had the beignets with a chocolate milk. They were fresh and piled high with confectioners sugar, as the picture shows. They were crispy enough to satisfy that desire, but soft enough not to be overdone like funnel cakes. The taste was great: simple with enough fat to balance out the sugar so it wasn't too sweet. Definitely worth the less than $2 charge. 

The ambiance was fine, having seating both inside (with A/C) and outside. It was cafeteria style. And, for those who don't feel like even stepping out of their cars, there is a drive through. Otherwise, parking is relatively easy (they have their own lot), unlike at the original cafe in downtown New Orleans. Then again, here in this place outside downtown, you're surrounded by memories of anywhere else: Taco Bell, gas stations, etc."
802,They have good nonpariel cookies.
803,"Pleasantly surprised by the presentation of the nice selections.  If I were not here for a biz trip, I would be planning my next visit back!  Good food!"
804,"Stopped in here for lunch after I had finished my work down the street. This was actually my second visit to Pi. I had been a couple of years ago during my first visit to St. Louis and I liked the pizza so much that I had to come back.
I was the only person in the place. I came in at that weird time between lunch and dinner rush. Regardless, the bartender was super friendly. He chatted me up about all of the local beers they have. I finally settled on a Schlafly pumpkin because it's me and it's fall. I didn't have pizza on this visit (not because it isn't amazing because it is, but because I couldn't eat a whole pizza on my own). Instead I ordered a Cesar salad and the meatball appetizer. 
First off the salad was freaking huge!!! It was tasty for a Cesar salad though they really are hard to mess up. The meatball appetizer was awesome! You get about 5 meatballs in sauce and covered with cheese alongside a few pieces of bread. The salad and meatballs were the perfect lunch.
I'll be back friends, as soon as work takes me to St. Louis again."
805,"Service was ok, but the food was excellent.  Nothing against our sweet server, but she was alone on a 20 person table - really? I completely blame that one on management! 

Buffalo cauliflower was awesome and the chicken skewers were so so good!  Everyone had a wonderful time! 

Ambiance was so fun!"
806,"My husband and I have eaten at M3 at least six times, and each meal has been delicious. The mini tacos with braised beef are a meal, as is the quesadilla. I recommend ordering them with a side of M3's slaw, which is a fresh blend of apples, carrots and cabbage. The Pasta Rustico is outstanding and something you can't get anywhere else. We've tried three sandwiches: lamb burger, prime rib dip and bacon & cheese melt. We recommend all of them. I'll gladly add the 5th star as soon as they develop a cocktail menu. :)"
807,"Good but maybe a little over hyped. I got the Brussel sprouts and the shrimp and grits. The sauce on the sprouts is overwhelming. It was like eating spoonfuls of bbq sauce. Too sweet and too spicy. And the shrimp and grits was better, but also saucy. A little goes a long way."
808,I got the chicken waffles it was very delious and flavorful. They should expand their breakfast menu because some items you had to get separately causing the price to increase a lot.
809,"If you are from the South (as in Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, South Carolina) this Mexican Restaurant will taste a lot like the yummy, cheap and greasy Mexican Restaurants that you are used to back home.  If you are from Texas-- you won't like this place. You'll think the food is too bland for your liking.  

I am from the South and love their steak tacos (with cilantro, cheese and pico), their margaritas are CHEAP and great and the service is pretty good.  

Mi Ranchito's always has a crowd.  This is the perfect date night restaurant-- two can dine and drink for around $20 bucks."
810,"Got the island green smoothie, pretty good prices and great tasting smoothie. Detoxing this Wolfpack sweet sixteen loss away"
811,"The food here is very good, little over priced for being in a strip mall and having no real ambiance but the food reminds me of  restaurants  in Center City, so I keep going back! Would definitely recommend!"
812,"In the area and found this location on Yelp. The young cashier asked if it was our first visit and offered samples before we ordered. He even gave us a free gift because it was our first time visiting. The food was fantastic! Full of flavor and huge portions. I tried pulled pork, baked beans, and corn pudding. Among the best baked beans I've ever had. My husband thought the pulled chicken had a bit of a bitter taste and his Mac and cheese looked a little bland. He offered to let me try it, but I would have had to share my beans and, despite the love I have for the man, I didn't want to. I deducted one star on behalf of his bitter chicken. Definitely recommend the restaurant, though."
813,"Delicious pho, the rare beef in particular is amazing. The best pho I've had in Delco so far."
814,"Just went to In Riva for the first time. I had heard they had a dog area and wanted to enjoy the evening with my Benny. The Pizza-n-Puppies area was great. The tables were  a little low (dogs could easily reach if they wanted) but considering I've never seen something like it before, I really liked the concept. 

I had the Mushroom and Zucchini pizza and it was alright. The crust was amazing, but I didn't know the pie would have a kick and I truly dislike spicy. Next time I know to tell them no spice and they'll leave it off. I think without the spice the pizza would be great.

UPDATE: I have been to In Riva a few times since writing this original post. Just say don't add spice and the pizza will come out amazing. At least, if you're like me and don't like food spicy.

Check their Facebook page before heading out on a Tuesday because you need a password for half price pizza."
815,"Our last minute decision to try Asian Chef was based on reviews we read on Yelp.
We went as a family and reserved in advance. Upon our arrival we realized that the space was small but well furnished. This is not a tablecloth type of a restaurant. The staff was friendly and informative about their menu. The staff was able to provide a clear and concise description of what the raw material for each dish was and what the final dish would taste like. Their advice was accurate, beneficial and helpful. All the appetizers were delivered timely and were delicious. The main entrees were the same. The sushi was fresh and was made to our particular request. The portions were generous and well presented on new dishes with interesting designs. Our three issues with the establishment were 1) the establishment was understaffed  (wait staff).  We must reemphasize again the staff was timely and professional 2) hot food was served on cold dishes. 3) The website Asian Chef was small.

We highly recommend that you to try Asian Chef. Please remember that the Asian Chef is BYOB and thus you should come prepared with several selections to pair with this unique restaurant's menu. The menu choices are plentiful and run the gamut from Sushi to Spicy Vietnamese food.

Enjoy!"
816,"This place has the most amazing burger in philly. I've tried the village burger and the whiskey king. they're both amazing, but I don't know if spending an extra $15 for the foie gras is worth it. It is nice to have foie gras like maybe once a year. Although the village burger is only $11, after you add all the extra stuff that they charge ridiculous price for, like mushrooms ($5), the burger will come out to like $20. It's totally worth it though."
817,We had the Crazy Old Goat and Turkey Presto with a side of mac & cheese. The sandwiches were very good and we can't wait to try others. The mac & cheese was good but nothing out of the ordinary. Definitely recommend!
818,"Excellent meal! We shared a very nice size portion Mediterranean Salad which they split into two plates. My better half enjoyed the white shrimp scampi and I ordered the Black Bass With risotto and fresh veggies. The fish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. Their homemade desserts were extremely appealing. We decided on the coconut cream cake and lemon sorbet- both excellent!!"
819,Pretty cool place to come as a one time thing If you're a Nashville tourist. Filling meal but busy and small building but otherwise super yummy and good spot.
820,"Around the street from our hotel this place was great for morning coffee and a pastry.

Just had hot tea and a blueberry muffin.  Looks like there's a local crowd that adds to the atmosphere.  Very nice place."
821,"Held a baby shower here recently for my daughter .  Marissa was very helpful in the planning and I think everyone enjoyed themselves.  We used the main dining room and bar area.  The brunch food we chose was plentiful and mostly yummy although the grits were a bit bland .  We had sampled the shrimp and grits which were very good when scouting the place but the cheesy grits I had on that date
Did not compare - however the rest of the food - including sausage , bacon , eggs and pancakes was yummy .  I wish their pastries included some kind of iced cinnamon roll mostly because that's a favorite of mine but also because it would have been more festive than the small muffins which were a
Bit dry - the glazed donut/ roll was good though .  The only real issue was that the drink station - serve themselves coffee and hot water in thermal vessels and juices plus champagne to make mimosas - was not out until about 30 minutes after guests arrived -- and the juice carafes were very small - almost like what you'd place on one table so kept needing refill ( I think when it appears like there is only a small amount guests will be influenced to not tAke much out of politeness so should look plentiful ) also twice when I went for coffee it was empty -- although they did refill it when asked .  
The staff was very pleasant - the bartender was helpful and good about our taking up his entire bar top .  
I'd highly recommend this as a party venue or just as a good brunch place"
822,"Zimmer's Seafood, located at an underdeveloped pedestrian friendly intersection in the heart of Voscoville, prepares arguably the best dressed shrimp po-boy in town (Castnet's are very good as well). You pay for quality here as Zimmer's is not the cheapest but we want real shrimp not the dried bite sized variety right? Of course. My only gripe is that they are closed on Sundays in opposition to my stomach's occasional Sunday po-boy craving. Check it out!"
823,"Their kitchen is open until 2am in Old City everyday, need I say more? Their food is great and they have a wonderful beer selection. I'm definitely a fan and will be returning anytime I'm in Old City. Also get their sweet potato fries, some of the best I've ever had!"
824,"What a wonderful surprise to find this gem in downtown Reno.   Food was delicious.  Try the Fried Chicken salad.  Soooo good.  Also had the burger that tasted like it was grilled outside.  Their fries were thin and delicious.  The service was five star.
They offered a variety of wonderful dinner fair.  Check out the menu online.  I will definitely go there again."
825,Best shrimp and grits I ever had! I had read reviews before going and some were negative. Decided to try anyway and glad I did. The wait staff was wonderful and so was our dinner. Wine list is somewhat limited but had a glass of viognier with dinner. Yum!  They're a little overpriced but I would go there again
826,"Let me start off by saying the BBQ shrimp at Mr. B's was the single best plate of food I had while in New Orleans. Spent almost five days there, and didn't enjoy any dish more. 

Staff was really friendly and we enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant. Felt like we were in a throwback New York joint. 

The only reason I'm not giving them 5-stars is because the crab cake, although mostly crab, was not very flavorful and overpriced for just being a single serving. 

So, if you want BBQ shrimp, I'd recommend this place 11 times out of 10."
827,Driving through the area and looking for a place to grab a bite. The food is outstanding and the staff was supper nice. I wish I had a local like this near me!
828,"Best Greek salad I ever had, hands down. I ordered it to go, and it was packaged perfectly, dressing in portion cups, grilled chicken warm and wrapped in its own foil pouch. Veggies were all crisp and fresh and the feta was perfect. I'll def be back to test out the rest of the menu. Puts the other salad competitors to shame!"
829,"Absolutely delicious restaurant! Loved our server as well, he was extremely chill. Stupendous Service. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because it is a tourist-trap place that has astronomically priced meals. You're probably going to get that anywhere in this area of the city though. However, if you're wanting to try any Creole/New Orleans-specific means; they have it here. Great place to go if you're wanting to get a flavor for NOLA!"
830,"So I'll be honest, we came here for customer appreciation day and I tried to get my husband to leave at least three times before our order came.  The ambiance inside the restaurant is terrible - they've got some major issues.  First, the bathroom wasn't clean. Then, since it was a cold rainy day I was freezing inside with the fans on and asked them to turn off the fans. They had to pull out a ladder and climb up to the ceiling fans to turn them off. The booths are shoddily put together. The inside looks really run down.  We weren't offered beverages.  Then, a woman worker arrived and proceeded to BLAST, and I mean BLAST the music.  Look, me and my husband were the only people in the restaurant, I felt like she was trying to get us to leave.  First, some really inappropriate song came on - which she changed.  Then, she let TWO Adele songs play on full blast. Followed by some Glee/High School Musical Remix of ""I think I'm gonna marry you"". It was our worst nightmare.  So let me be clear, take your pizza to go. The interior of the restaurant gets zero stars.

I'm glad my husband convinced me to stay, because the pizza was phenomenal.  We've tried many a pizza places in St. Louis and this one is the best.  New York style, no provel, excellent sauce, excellent crust. The best!

My review is simple - awesome pizza - you have to try it. Just make sure you carry out."
831,"Cute location, there is a line, but pretty good food. Great location, but I was disappointed that when we arrived about 3:15, after being in line for about 15-20 minutes, we were informed that the ribs are only available at dinner time. Yes I rolled my eyes! But the cashier was very friendly and asked about how our trip was going so we decided to try out the pulled pork sandwich and several of their sides. Great food! Just disappointed I didn't get to try their ribs."
832,"I will eat ANYTHING in one of Pico De Gallo's handmade corn tortillas. I tend to eat the fish or the tongue tacos, but the barbacoa tacos are delicious , too. The beans are great. The rice is great. Sometimes the hot sauce is so spicy it will burn a hole through you, but really it's all about those corn tortillas."
833,Went here on a pub crawl so my review is only for the bar area.  Place was nicely set up on the inside. I am not much of a mixed drink drinker since I tend to lose my inhibitions when hard liquor is involved.  The two drinks that were recommended to me were a Pim's cup and Sazerac.  I went with the Pim's cup and it was one of the best mixed drinks I have had in a really long time. It was very smooth and very refreshing. The cucumber garnish gave it a nice twist.  Would like to go back for dinner and try the food.
834,"Our second time to Cafe Fleur De Lis!

We went to their other location a couple days ago.  The food was so good (had the shrimp n grits) that we had to come back for more!

The prices were reasonable for what you get.  The quality of food were good with service to match.  

I loved their shrimp and grits, but this time I had to try their Seafood Benedict (Seafood cakes made of crawfish and crab mixture).  It comes with a choice of hash brown (has a slight little kick) or grits.  My friends had the traditional breakfast of eggs Benedict and vegetable omelette. The coffee was good,  and so was the mocha coffee ( piled high whipped cream with drizzled chocolate on top). 

Overall, our second dining experience was great.

This is a little hidden ""Foodie Find"" and gem of a place.  You won't be disappointed."
835,"Super busy place...and it was a Tuesday! About a 45minute wait, but we hung out on their sofa and ordered beers and a starter. We started with the tameles and were not a fan of the mushy texture...that's just me tho as I'm a texture person. The main more than made up for it.

Atmosphere is really chill. I like the open concept and the tiny bar they had. 

The owner was walking around chatting it up with every table. He came by our little counter/table and was super friendly and have us lots of background 411 about the restaurant (eg. Chicken is organic and is from local Four Whistle farm). It's nice to talk with owners and see/hear their passion for their business.

We ordered the platter for 2 with the rotisserie and pork. Seriously so much food. We had lots for leftovers. I wasn't a big fan of the chicken (it was cold) but the pork and the chimichurri was soooo good! It came with a side of potatoes that were pretty tasty also.

For dessert we had to have the churro and really enjoyed it as well!  

This is a great place for a date night. Nice atmosphere and good menu. We'd definitely go back to try something different."
836,"Yesterday was my first experience at Thai Thanee.  The space was large and inviting.  As far as I could tell, there was only one waitress, but she was personable, attentive and fast.  

The chicken satay ranks among the best that I've EVER had, moist tender and very flavorful.  The basil with chicken was very good, even if not quite as spicy as I would have liked.  All in all the experience was very good.  I'll definitely be back to sample more of their menu..."
837,"Yum! We go on Sundays when kids eat free. Family of 5 eats dinner for under $25. Bar-b-q is yummy, nice portions, and free ice cream. I like pulled pork and the beef brisket, if you go late they may be sold out of some meats. 

My only complaint is the dining room is small and during dinner time there is a long wait for food and sometimes a seat. Despite this it's a family favorite."
838,"I tried the Gourmet Pizza Company for the first time last night after having lived down the street for 3 years.  For a Saturday night, it wasn't very busy but upon seeing all the cars parked outside, I expected it to be packed. I had the Mediterranean pizza and I thought it was excellent. Definitely satisfied my pizza craving! I will definitely return as it is just a quick walk down the street for me."
839,"To update, the business owner has been in contact and has apologized and made up for it. Overall the Bareburger experience in Center City does have potential to be a good restaurant to check out."
840,"Mellow Mushroom.... what a cool name!!  And the restaurant has mushrooms everywhere in it... cartoon mushrooms all over the walls... it's pretty awesome!

The pizza is really good and the crust is very tasty!  

Only complaints are: 1) when getting take out, the pizza doesn't stay very hot.  and 2) when it's closing time, they really do lock the door and don't pay attention to you if you are waiting outside to pick up your take out order.

other than that... Mellow Mushroom is pretty cool!"
841,"This restaurant was an unexpected positive surprise on a visit to St. Pete. 

They were quite busy and I can see why. Great specials, affordable prices, and a wide menu with tons of variety. 

I gave this four stars because the wait for the food was longer than expected, even with taking the busy atmosphere into consideration."
842,"Famoso Neapolitan Pizzeria is one of the places I go to on a regular basis for a good pizza that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.  Why is pizza so expensive in Edmonton? Is it because cheese is expensive in Canada?  As far as pizzas, I have ordered the Margherita, Abruzzo, Vesuvio, Siciliana, and Moo Shu BBQ Duck.  The pizza that I order the most often is the Abruzzo and the pizza that I found the most disappointing was the Moo Shu BBQ Duck.  The time I ordered it, I found the flavor profile of the whole okay, but the execution was poor.  The duck was overly oily and the hoisin sauce overwhelming.  The one time that we ordered the Caprese Salad, the cheese texture was soggy and lacking flavor.  We found that this preparation of the salad was inedible.  The manager came to the table to explain the ""artisan"" cheese and how it is sometimes not created in a consistent quality.  He removed the salad from our bill and kindly offered us a complimentary dessert which we declined. We made sure to give a generous tip to staff since the service was great regardless of the salad."
843,"Love the fact that you can access this place through the mall and it's garage. The interior looks more or less like an old library... takes us old folks back to our college days... nicely done... floating bookshelf over the bar... 

I wasn't overly impressed with the cocktail choices, I've been so spoiled lately from the vast collection of craft cocktails around town, so I just stuck to water. 

As I generally do drag my meet-up group with me, we had a table of 14 and this poor kid had to take care of all of us by himself. He got a little help when the main dishes came out, but other than that he was on his own. They even seated another table in his section. They knew we were coming, so I would say understaffed. Our waiter tried his hardest and he ran all night, but service could have been better had he gotten a bit more help or at least not be seated more tables. 

Anyway, let's get to the food. We often share dishes, so I had quite a few samples and here is my verdict:

Beer cheese tater tots: absolutely delicious, big portion, must have for any tater, cheese and/or bacon fan.. it hits all those areas.

Fried cauliflower: fantastic dish, also quite a portion, delicately breaded cauliflower fried to a crisp, tender but not mushy inside and served with an interesting ranch sauce.

Fried avocado: I was suspicious I must admit, but it turned out nice... not as big a portion as the other dishes, but nicely done. Coated avocados, deep fried, nice outer crunch, creamy middle, served with a grilled lime and a special ranch sauce... trickle some lime juice on the avocado and dip it in the ranch... omg good.

Shishito peppers: guess that's the new fad...basically roasted peppers... not as exciting as it may sound. The little sesame dip that came with it brought  most of the flavor for this dish. Lots of peppers though. 

Chilaquilles: seemed to be a nacho type creation with lots of chicken and cheese. Not bad, but I wouldn't go out of my for this dish, somewhat bland. big portion though.

French Fries: not worth it

Tater Tots: absolutely delicious

Onion rings: meh

Cucumber tomato salad: wonderful, large portion, nice vinaigrette, not overpowering, wonderfully light fresh salad. highly recommend giving it a try. 

Mac and cheese: good stuff

Doctorate burger: overrated and deemed not worthy of the price tag.

Double Major: good, but in my opinion was overdone and a bit dry.

French burger: a very drippy cheesy affair, nicely done though.

Overall I would say it's an ok burger spot. On the pricey side, but good for an occasional outing. I probably would just eat all the apps and sides because they were well worth it."
844,Food was reasonably priced and the portions were large. Half priced sushi on Wednesday is awesome. Service was really good. I would give it a try.
845,Renovation of the historic building was thoughtful and well executed. Food was great...service was excellent. Everyone in the party was impressed and will return.
846,"Tucked into a corner of a busy shopping center, the place was nearly empty when we walked in, but several other couples came in as we ate. The lunch menu, a mere two pages, seemed a bit limited. I ordered a meatball ricotta sandwich with salad, while my dad had a chicken Parmesan sandwich with homemade Parmesan fried potato chips. The salad was very fresh, with nice greens and homemade dressing. The potatoes, not quite as crisp as ordinary potato chips, were quite good. The meatballs were well above average, nicely seasoned and with generous but not overwhelming cheese. The chicken Parm looked rather flat, and my Dad did not finish it, proclaiming it ""not for me."" We finished up with Spumoni, very prettily presented with slivered almonds and a light drizzle of strawberry sauce. Service was friendly and attentive."
847,"My son and I LOVE pizza, we could seriously eat it more times a week than would be healthy.  A few days ago I read Jackie W.'s review of SLNPC and I knew that we would have to give this place a try.  Fast forward to a lazy Sunday afternoon with both of us hungry and craving some pizza.  SLNPC is literally 5 blocks from our house, so it was a no brainer to give this place a try.  

We walk in and the place is empty, but it had only been open about 10 minutes so I didn't let that deter us.  We had our choice of seats and were quickly helped by Zack.  As we were already quite hungry and not wanting to wait for a pizza to be made, we just grabbed some slices.  I opted to go simple and just go with the peperoni like my son.  Six minutes later I was staring two large New York style pieces of pizza in the face.  Big B delivered our pizza and when I asked for a knife to cut my son's pizza up he quickly offered to take it back and cut it up for me.  That was really cool, as anyone who has tried to cut a giant piece of pizza into bite size pieces with a plastic knife knows is no easy task.  

Now, on to the pizza.  It was delicious, I inhaled both of my giant pieces and my five year old son pretty much ate all of his piece.  He left about 3 bites and the crust.  I was completely full, but very satisfied.  To follow in tradition, I folded my slice in half and was please to see the bottom of the slice cooked perfectly.   

Zack was kind enough to offer my son a Popsicle which made him very happy.  Prices were pretty good for a per slice deal.  The prices on their signature pizzas were reasonable as well.  Next time I venture into this place I will have to try the Big Baller as Jackie W.'s description of it still makes me very hungry.    This visit ended with two big thumbs and two pint sized thumbs way up for Big B and his people at the SLNPC.  Keep up the good work and I'll be back to try more of your menu out."
848,"This is a cute lunch spot (that also serves breakfasts and teas/coffees/smoothies) where the focus is on fresh ingredients. The tortilla soup that I ordered was piping hot which is HUGE, as it seems like there is an epidemic going around of lukewarm/underheated food. While I waited for it to cool, I sampled the garden salad that my dining companion ordered. For a side salad, the portion was generous. The balsamic vinaigrette was tasty and an elevated alternative to the usual oil and vinegar dressing. The coffee drinks looked inventive as well. For add ons, I recommend the Billy Goat Chips. One also can't go wrong with one of the chocolate-chip cookies (all of the baked goods and desserts are made in house)."
849,Delicious food. All the food is made to order fresh as it can be. The service is fast and really friendly. If your a grilled cheese lover and quesadilla lover this is the place for you. The soups are made fresh everyday and is different option everyday. We will be coming back.
850,"We came here for lunch since my very special guest was on a very special diet and this place seemed like there was a wide range of options to choose from. We got seated pretty fast. The food portions were huge! I got a steak quesadilla and it came with soup, a pretty big salad  and fries! I obviously could not finish it all and had to take most of it home. They could, however, do a little better job on seasoning the food. The prices are very reasonable."
851,"Last minute reservations for outdoor seating when I found my other choice closed, and I'm happy as can be. Took our group of eight foodies there, including some chefs, after doing the nearby Jean LaFittes Swamp Tour, my friends wanting to spring for early supper, and it was outrageously good. I've included photos, the bill, and partial menu to help you, so I'll just hit the main points here. VICTORIA was our server, and with minimal assistance, she killed it like a stone-cold professional, waiting hand and foot on eight discriminating but fun foodies and cooks, has a memory like a steel trap, always a winning smile, and I'm impressed, big-time. Ask for her. This was a five-star review theirs to lose, and it was only with the presentation of my lemon wedge for my initial iced tea order, that all-important first impression one never can take back, that they lost the fifth star. NEVER bring decaying, slimy citrus to a group of peeps who are about to spend five or six hundred dollars in your restaurant. See photos. Now, from there on out, I'm telling you straight: This gorgeous restaurant, and its outstanding cuisine, which sits in a Louisiana swamp, would thrive just as well in Manhattan or Beverly Hills.  There are seriously talented chefs there, and they bring their A-Game. EVERY dish is perfect, with deep French roots that show through in the sauces and roux construction; fish, shrimp and all other seafood items sparkling fresh, harvested from the waters within sight of the dining areas. From the elegant indoor dining areas which overlook the bayou to the outdoor area with stone flooring and fireplace, this is a WINNER."
852,"My name is Angela S. and I have a Froyo problem. No, really. I don't even like it that much, yet I continue to go to all of these stupid frozen yogurt joints like some dairy-crazed masochist and eat $4.17 worth of disappointment at a time. 

And then came Tutti Frutti. 

It's good. It's a little different. The toppings are just so-so, but the yogurt itself is really good. They have interesting flavors, including Taro. If you haven't tried something taro flavored, Tutti Frutti is a good place to start. It doesn't even need toppings. 

With so many froyo places in STL, it's rare that I've visited the same one twice, but Tutti Frutti could become a standby."
853,"Service was a little slow but food makes up for it. I had the shepherd pie and my husband had the trout. Wow, it was super tasty!"
854,"In short: Nice atmos, great food, nice portions. Mexican/ Spanish fusion Latin cuisine I suppose you could call it. On a recent getaway with my sig other in Montecito we came to this place on some Yelp recommendations. 

5 stars for the food and portions. Wine list a little overpriced...

They lost one star and ended up with 4 because the waiter didn't quite know if the plate had anything hot on it which I specifically asked NOT to have on my plate. Not into hot and spicy foods... Sure enough on a bite my head was nearly burned off to the neck from some burning hot green pepper in the mix... so I didn't appreciate that. That's a slack oversight on the part of the waiter. He obviously didn't mention it to the kitchen.


For lunches and brunches they have a nice outdoor seating area as well. Also a full bar inside. They also have a totally separate cute little building, a private VIP dining area for parties / meetings and such but with a $500 min spend.

We had a salmon and a seared sea bass entree. So, for two with an appetizer, two glasses of fine Napa Valley wine, a port and dessert to finish up our total bill with tip came to $100."
855,"Our go to place for cheap cheerful and awesome. Love the staff, brisk and efficient but will crack an occasional smile. Everything's good but try the special turkey club."
856,Happy International Burger Day! We have been coming here for a couple years and haven't been disappointed. Hubby always has the Spicy Crunch combo and I had the Double Mushroom Double Cheese combo one with curly fries the other with regular fries each came with ketchup and a herb aioli as well as a fountain pop. I have also tried the Blue Cheese burger and their signature BJ Burger which are equally delicious. Fresh quality ingredients are used. We would give it a 5 but we thought the tables and benches could be updated. You have the option of customizing your burgers as a mini clip board and marker are at each table with a list of ingredients. Unfortunately diners have scribbled on the tables and benches. Perhaps a sheet of glass or plexiglass on the tables would make it easier to clean.
857,My family and I ate at Bub's today.  The burgers and milk shakes were very good.  The service was excellent.  We will be going back.
858,"After a dismal dinner at our former favorite sushi restaurant in Jackson, TN, we decided to get another sushi dinner, this time at Samurai in Nashville, TN.  WOW!  What a difference!  The fish in the rolls were super fresh and the pickled ginger wasn't dyed a day-glo pink!   We had the Dr. Dave roll, the Choo Choo roll, and a roll our waitress recommended that was topped with mango.  All three were delicious!  The Choo Choo roll is topped with strawberries which added an extra dimension to the flavor of the roll I haven't experienced before.  The size of the place is small, be prepared to wait.  We got lucky because it was Fall break at Vanderbilt so we got in right away.  The decor is very low key so don't expect high end service and decked out chic crowds with funky music ala Pod in Philadelphia.  The focus of Samurai is the food, period.  I highly recommend this place!"
859,"Not sure where all the love has gone, cus this is a great place to eat! The food is nice and yummy, and so are the drinks! 

Don't be surprised if you order a couple drinks and entrees and your bill is closer to 100$ for two, but it's worth the price...top to bottom the food has always been a delight...except the shoe string fries...they are a side to be avoided...they are too thin a cut of potato...otherwise, a nice place and good place to eat :-)

If you are looking to save a few dollars, go for happy hour and sit at the bar...they have good deals for happy hour!"
860,"By now you've read what type of place this is.  It was just as fun and hip as others say.  Some of the food was excellent, some just good.  Nothing was disappointing."
861,"I can't speak for the previous person's server but mine was pleasant....both to interact with and on the eyes (yes I am female) she was paitent with me as I gingerly gazed at the menu. She suggestes the combo since I couldn't shake the falafell calling but wanted some meat. Picked chicken and beef, and the beef was the winner. Falafell is a staple of middle eastern food and not all good places make good balls. THESE DID NOT DISAPPOINT. Crunchy and not over fried, I had a huge bowl of humus and baba to baste on. The tumeric in their homemade yogurt is so light and smooth it almost wants me to have another STL trip to come and eat a shwarma sandwich mid day!  Don't let the set back strip mall suprise you. Leave the inhabitions at the door wear elastic pants and get ready for dinner and a show. OBTW I passed on the hooka"
862,"My first time - won't be last!!!  Smoky aromas hit you when you enter.  Everything is home made  my guest had the daily sausage sandwich. Excellent texture and flavour  my sandwich was filled with tender beef cheese and their homemade candied beets  large portions rustic decor. Open kitchen.   Vegans stay home although their roasted veg side dish was great!!!!
I need to go back and try brunch! real meat. Real cooking. Oh and dark rye.  Yum"
863,"This delicious ramen really warmed me up! I had the miso ramen and I loved the flavor profile of the broth. The noodles were tasty and the picked vegetables added a great contrast to the heartiness of the broth that kept the flavor balanced and not too savory. I also added on the black garlic wings because they were having a lunch special (add an app for $4). I was not a huge fan; even with lime juice sprinkled on the top, the fry on the wings was too heavy for me; I wonder if they were twice-fried? While I appreciated the crispiness, I would pass on these the next time around. I would add a caution that the restaurant is small and filled up for weekday lunch by about 12:15; they only have 4 2-person tables, 1 4-person table, and then the seats at the bar. However, this is a great place to come for a solid bowl of ramen, especially if it's cold outside."
864,"Recently visited on a Friday night and had a great meal and experience. Started with a white organic white- very nice for a ""green"" wine.

Ordered the Banh Mi special and Mahi Tacos. Food was delicious. Real, wholesome ingredients. You can tell the owner and kitchen care about the food.

Enjoyed the nice music on the well-put-together patio, too. 

We'll definitely be back."
865,"Dorignac's is a great local grocery store.  They have tons of local products, as well as national brands.  The quality is pretty good.  The employees are friendly and helpful.  I only wish they had a couple more locations.  I only go here when I'm in the area, and that's not very often."
866,"Epic. God I love pizza.

Obama was right.

Do I really need to say more?

Sorry this wasn't a haiku."
867,"Burgers were ok. Service was a little slow, which was surprising considering it was dead in there. Apps were fantastic!"
868,"Had the patrol combo with a fresh squeezed orange juice and loved it! Cage free eggs were cooked well. Sausages were very high quality and not fatty. Even the jam that came with the toast was pretty good. It tasted natural, not too sweet with actual fruit preserves in it!

The luau french toast , made on hawaiian bread was pretty good too.

The only downside is that the wait for the food itself is a bit longer ,but nothing unreasonable. I think it took about 15 to 20 minutes for the food to come out. As long as you have some time to spare , I would recommend giving this place a try. Ingredients are healthy and fresh. 

There is parking right across from the restaurant."
869,"The last time I was here was when I was in high school at the OLD restaurant (if anyone remembers that).  Very nice set up inside, comfy booths, nice staff.  Our pizza took a little longer than anticipated but was tasty, their presentation was the most intriguing.  They slice the pizza in half and place each half on different tiers to bring out to the table.  Have local crafted beers on tap from Mastry's brewing.   Good selection of food."
870,"My mother and I stopped in here for lunch upon recommendations from friends. I tried the Daily Bread Special and she had the Veggie. We both loved our sandwiches! We also split a bowl of Turkey Noodle soup. That was a nice complement to our meal. We bought a Gooey Butter Cake, too, which was absolutely outstanding. 

Only gripe was marginally friendly staff and a very slim variety of chips. 

Definitely give the Daily Bread a try!"
871,Good basic pizza. Good crust. Typical older pizza place environment. Friendly to newbies. Would go there again.
872,I was really good pizza and wings. I would definitely come back. We came with kids and it was ok. I guess it depends on what you have in mind for the atmosphere. There's a lot of tvs so with kids it can be distracting but that's what people are there for to watch a game and eat pizza. Overall good and definitely good food.
873,"Good food, parking hard to find. Great for businesses lunch. Great historic building. I had short ribs definitely going to order again."
874,"The best way I can summarize Capogiro is that it's a great luxury dessert. Small portions with phenomenal taste. You don't eat Capogiro's for sustenance or to fill up, you eat it simply to enjoy the taste. 

I think Capogiro's real strength is that it manages to create great texture without compromising the integrity of flavor. 

That said, my absolute favorite is the pomelo/grapefruit. Very sweet and tangy without tasting artificial at all."
875,"The food here is fantastic but I'm taking away a star because of the service, which is often slow. If the food weren't great I wouldn't come back here because the service isn't worth it. They seem to not have enough people working there to keep up with all of the people and orders. On a more positive note, their sushi is some of the best I've had. (Pokémon Go roll is addictive.) Their beef Korean tacos are delicious and huge. My daughter gets the sweet potato waffle fries and finishes them, she never finishes anything except for those. I recommend this place for the food but go there expecting to wait a long time for everything."
876,"Went there on a reservation through Open table. Everything went smooth. I had the chicken rice soup along with the Wild boar meatloaf, mashed potatoes and asparagus. Asparagus were too big, but tasty. Also had a side of brussel sprouts that were excellent! Wife had the grilled chicken. Food and service was very good. BYOB    Just a little noisy. Would recommend."
877,"I have eaten at Vecchia Osteria twice in the last few weeks, once in the restaurant and then for take out. Both experiences were very good. When dining-in the service was prompt and the owner very friendly and accommodating to a large party. The place has a very nice atmosphere with outside seating available. 

Some stand-out dishes were the lamb chops, gorgonzola gnocchi, and the desserts were great - amazing cannolis, tiramisu, and a lemon cake. It is a bit pricey, but fair in comparison to other local italian restaurants."
878,"Very cute and quaint inside, of course what else can you expect from a location inside Eagle Village! The service was very good and the food was good too. Overall I had a very pleasant brunch experience with my friend."
879,Went there tonight courtesy of a Groupon purchase and was pleasantly surprised at the array of dishes. Decided to go with the Fried Pork Chop sandwich which very good. My girlfriend had the crab cakes with mac & cheese and mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious and we'll be definitely making a return trip b
880,"Taste is individual, and this reviewer thinks the fro-yo tastes great.  The flavors and consistencies are just right for the following I have tried: vanilla, strawberry-banana, coconut, mango, lychee, almond, and pistachio.  The toppings are fine and the people working there seem pleasant.  Like the outdoor seating.

The downside is the layout inside -- it is cramped and narrow.  It makes navigation difficult (esp. with a stroller).

Make sure you get the Tutti Fruitti card punched out with each purchase!"
881,"We encountered a short wait but were called in about10 minutes. We ordered garlic clams, clam chowder, fresh oysters and the crab sandwich. Got photos of most, except the crab sandwich as it was soooo delicious it was gone before I managed to take a photo!

Service is ok but super casual. 

Great fresh seafood. Yum."
882,Up  and  on  the  way  to  becoming  an  Island  must ! Surrounded by Plenty  of  tough  competition ! They're  finding  their  way to  consistency  in building  a fantastic  addition  to  the  local's  hearts !
883,"Food was a 3.5 or so, but our server Kiki pushed our rating up to 4.

Oysters on half shell were good (but so damn big!).   BBQ oysters were really tasty.   Turtle soup - solid and spicy.   BBQ shrimp - wife loved it, I thought just ok."
884,"Updating so soon just to say that Nhu Y really hooked up my hoagies today. 

As usual we got vegetarians #5 and #8 to split. By ""we"" I am, of course, employing the use of the royal ""we."" Maybe I was saving one for later. Those bahn mi had the perfect amount of hot peppers and herbaceousness tucked into that crusty roll. I get covered in crumbs by these things. I present that to you as a good thing, though, you may be ridiculed as a Messy-Marvin.

I just want to add that it was pretty adorable to watch the older husband and wife team silently making my sandwiches together. Whatever, I'm being all mushy about things but it was sweet to me for some reason. So what? Monster have...feelings?"
885,"Awesome HH in Webster! For one, HH goes until 7pm so there's plenty of time to get there after work (and get at least a couple drinks in on HH special :-) ). They have $5 cocktail/draft beer specials and certain $2.50 bottles. They also have a number of bar eats for $5-$8. Per Yelp's recommendation I tried the Potted Pig and it was a fantastic plate of food. The pork confit has a pastey/tuna-like texture; on its own it's a tad too pork-y but with the pickled veg and grape chutney you get a nice balance of salty, sweet, and acid in each bite. I also appreciate that the bread is grilled and seasoned. These little details make a difference.

I also like the ambience. Relaxed, rustic-hipster. They sell some of their own meats at the front counter - bonus points in my book."
886,Huge oysters when I was there.  Great service!  Had a muffuletta  (half).  It was all very tasty!
887,"I wandered into this restaurant yesterday while I had time to kill before a social meeting. I ordered a chicken Caesar salad, and then followed in up with a coffee cake and a cup of joe. It was perfect! Healthful, fresh, perfectly priced, and pleasant people behind the counter. I look forward to going back and getting something more ambitious. In the meantime, I encourage my friends who frequent Doylestown to look into this little gem of a place. Like a fine diamond, it is damned near perfect."
888,"I had the Porterhouse there and it was great.  Perfectly cooked at medium rare.  The spouse had the filet mignon and she didn't enjoy her piece of meat as much as I did.  The filet was a little overcooked for medium rare.  The lobster mac and the sweet potato fries were good though.  

Surprisingly, the service was fast.  The food came out pretty quick.  Nice choice for a steakhouse in St. Louis County."
889,Gator gumbo with fried mac and cheese.  Great food with just the right amount of kick for a late lunch.
890,"Great pizza as always. I grew up in maryland and this location is just as good as the ones up there. the sauce is sweet, which i usually don't like, but they pull it off. its like pizza candy. this location brings down another taste from the north in the form of Boylan's Birch Beer and a couple others. i only really noticed the birch beer because its hard to find. A four pack is $6.49 or something. will be returning if i can make the 40 minute drive from clearwater again. open one closer to me please."
891,"This place is such an unheralded gem. When I want brunch, I usually go one end of the spectrum or the other. I either want crab eggs Benedict and a mimosa or I want greasy bacon and hashbrowns.  3 sisters sits at about 75% toward the former on that continuum. 

I got the ham sandwich that was featured on DD&D.  An amazing sandwich. Kind of like a southern Cuban sandwich.  I know it's not breakfast food but it was nearly noon and that sandwich is hard to deny. 

My wife got an omelette that was just perfect.  Pick up to five add-ins which is a nice format compared to most places that nickel and dime you for each personalization. 

I had hoped to save room for the bacon chocolate pie but it just wasn't in the cards. 

The ambiance is very homey and quaint.  Big fan of this place."
892,"This place was pretty good. We came here on a Friday evening right before 6. Happy hour was just about to end, but we were able to get $1 oysters on HH. I ordered the jambalaya pasta and my bf ordered a pound of crawfish. It took a really long time to get our food. My food came first before the crawfish and oysters. I was halfway through my meal when the crawfish finally came out. My bf finished the crawfish and then the oysters came out last, a little weird, but at least everything was really good. 

The oysters were fresh, the crawfish was amazing. We really enjoyed how they make their crawfish here. It was seasoned just enough, but you can still taste the freshness of the crawfish and it was super sweet and juicy. We eat a lot of crawfish back in Cali, but having it here in NO, you can't beat it. I also liked my jambalaya pasta as well, it was tasty, but nothing special about it. 

Overall, we had a really good experience. The restaurant is right in the heart of Nolo. So definitely a good place to check out."
893,Great crab  soup. But too much cheese.   Service the best. Unfortunately music started at 930.   The ground were gorgeous. Would of loved to sit outside.
894,"Had graduation dinner for 21 the other night. Everyone enjoyed the food greatly. Dinner,drinks and desserts were awesome! Thank you for a wonderful experience!"
895,"Everything about this place is great. Located in Historic Reading Terminal, quick service, flavorful dishes... :)

I don't know anywhere else in Philly that you can get amazing, authentic New Orleans food.

I seriously salivate thinking about how amazing the bread pudding with the whiskey butter sauce is... MMMMMMmmmmmmm !!!!!

The jambalaya, cajun chicken alfredo, and gumbo are also so yum. 

The owner (I hear also a professional caterer on the side) loves New Orleans food. 

Go here when you go to Reading Terminal, trust me."
896,A little pricey.  But very good.  The food is pretty spicy.   I would suggest the dan dan and the fish casserole.
897,"Love this BYOB.  Albeit the environment is cramp and loud, so not a good place for an intimate dinner.   However, the food always lures us back.  The grilled, whole fish is wonderful.  My husband is a big fan of the lamb.   It's a good lively night out, with wonderful full flavored food and attentive, friendly service."
898,"This place gets a solid 4 stars from me. This past Sunday at 12:40 at night (I guess that would make it Monday by then...) I got the biggest craving for a pizza. I called around to a few places to try to find someone open but came up empty handed. That was when my boyfriend recalled a place called Imperial Pizza that his buddies talked about. Sure enough they were open and we put our order in and in 10 minutes it was ready for pick up. Not gonna lie, it was not the BEST pizza I ever had. But for 6 bucks and being the only place open to serve me at that hour it was pretty damn good.

 A few nights later around the same time I got a craving for a cheese steak. I decided to try one from there. Eh. They had no wiz so I got it with american and it was an 8 inch roll. Not that much meat on the sandwich and the roll was pretty chewy. BUT it cost me 5 dollars I believe. For 5 dollars I can't really complain about it to much. 

I know I'll be heading back there soon enough for more pizza when I'm up late at night. You got a fan here!"
899,"Went to Luke during a bachelor party weekend which, on this night was 12 guys.
We made a reservation, but unfortunately they were not ready for us.  

But they had a bar area and we sat there and had some drinks, clams and oysters.
The service was very good as well.  

Once we were seated everyone ordered and seemed to enjoy their food.  But what I can say is, that we were mostly drunk already and just wanted to eat.

This place was had lots of New Orleans type dishes.  I went with a steak, not really sure why, but maybe because I was so hungry, I just wanted to be full.

Other than that, I can't say anything really stuck out, but the service was good, my food was good and the staff was good."
900,"Literally my favorite restaurant here in New Orleans. My friend told me I need to invest in the restaurant between going there so much and ordering on postmates. I love the atmosphere and the food of course! I order the same thing every time! Pork and shrimp rolls, shakin new york strip with fried rice add egg, and a cobbler to drink! I try looking at the menu to try something new, but my heart knows what it wants. It's never too crowded, and has an overall good vibe."
901,"Standard Subway, nothing special. Fast, friendly service. They have gotten rid of the Monterey Cheddar bread though, so that sucks."
902,"If you like Mac n Cheese you will love this place. It's located on a very busy street filled with shops and other surrounding restaurants. Mac Mart is very small so not ideal for crowds. Not a lot of seating but based on there niche it's probably expected. 
They have a variety of options on how you want your dish. I went with the Jalapeño Poppers. Service was quick and my food was ready in no time. They do serve you your dish in a Rubbermaid type of container which doesn't look like much but it was very filling. The dish it's self was great, I loved it!! I would highly recommend this place for all  Mac n Cheese lovers.
I also like how they encourage you to keep the container b/c it's reusable and encourages recycling.
Overall service was good"
903,"Delicious. So delicious. Why do they not have a sign anywhere that says CASH ONLY? We definitely had to send my brother out to get cash when the bill came. Embarrassing.

I had the Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles) which were delicious. Though the menu said they'd be spicy, and they didn't even have a slow burn thing going on. Next time, I would get it spicier. Lots of beef in it though, they definitely did not skimp on that.

My parents both ate Pad Thai and loved it. I snagged a bite of my mom's Chicken Pad Thai and it was pretty yummy. I prefer greasy spicy noodles though.

The desserts here are so so good. A bit overpriced maybe ($6 a piece), but delicious. I had the sticky mango rice, my mother ate the chocolate banana egg roll, my brother had the banana tempura. All yummy.  My dad clearly made the right choice when he ordered the coconut ice cream. It came in half a coconut and there was SO MUCH ICE CREAM. I dont' know if they make it on location, or if they get it elsewhere, but I could definitely eat it every day.

I'm going to drag my brother here for the rest of the time he's at UPenn. I'm into it."
904,"Decided to try this place since it's close to my house...it was a good gamble.  Fish was fresh and the chefs were really attentive to us.  We were in there before a dinner ""rush"" so I can't speak to what it would be like if it was super busy, but we were pleased and would definitely go back."
905,"Very fast service, good food, and a fun/kitschy Mexican restaurant atmosphere. This is the kind of place I go to when I'm craving regular, good, fast Mexican food."
906,"Had a really good sandwich here once, and a damn good burger here another time. I've always been impressed with their tap list, and can always find something new to drink here. Bartenders and servers seem really nice.

It's dimly lit but doesn't feel like a dive... it's too hip for that. I haven't spent enough time here to give it a real honest assessment, but I like what I've seen so far."
907,"Made a quick stop in New Orleans & we're so glad we stopped here for lunch! The food was amazing. We ordered the crab cake and blacked fish - both so fresh and delicious. On top of that, they had $4 bloody mary's!
The service was great too - very knowledgeable about the food and the history of the building. They even shared some ghost stories with us, too bad we didn't run into the ghost of Antoine.
After eating we explored the building & sat on the balcony upstairs. The balcony overlooks Jackson Square and it's such a beautiful view. Such a great spot to sit, drink, and hear live music from the street :)"
908,The people there were super nice. Pizza came out really fast. They have like 40 different toppings to chose from. Pizza was above average.
909,"They have a drink menu that would fit any palate. It's one of the few restaurants I have seen with a Pimm's Cup on the menu... the food menu is also extensive. Try the popcorn which has quite a kick to it, that can be offset by any beverage. They also have many vegan options, which is great for those friends that are vegan and always complaining about finding somewhere to eat. The BBQ Vegan Pulled Pork was delicious, as were the sweet potato fries and collared greens. It was a Sunday, so service was a bit overwhelmed by the large crowd. Don't go if you have a time limit. Also, found the background music a bit too loud."
910,I love this place. They have the best chicken gyros and gyros. Their pasta salad and is awesome and so is their hummus. Love the mural on the wall. I have eaten here about once a month for the past two years. Usually my in laws ordering to go and someone picks it up and brings it home. always awesome. Never a bad meal. BUT i would really suggest to the owners / workers for everyone to work on their customer service and attitude. Hence missing a star. A couple of times I have walked in 10 minutes before they close to get a to go order - they seemed annoyed. Other than that this place is ACES! If you go get the chicken gyro with a salad of pasta salad. go good! Everything is always crazy fresh tasting.
911,"Had a great time at this BYOB near Northern Liberties. It's just a little bit out of the way, so though I really enjoyed it many years ago when it first opened, I had not been until I saw a Living Social deal for a gift certificate and decided to try it again. 

Am glad I did! The sauces are well made and use a variety of great chiles for this-is-definitely-not-from-a-jar-like-other-""mexican""-restaurants quality. I ended up having the empanaditas and a great cactus salad and was really impressed with the range of flavors. They have a wide ranging menu and several great sounding specials. 

We also lucked out because the people next to us had thoughtfully brought more tequila than they needed and let us have a few glasses of the BYOT margaritas. The mixes were fresh and flavorful and they will mix the tequila in for you. 

Our only complaint was because it was so small, every margarita order meant we had to be very near a loud blender, but that's a small price to pay for excellent food, friendly service, and a lovely little restaurant."
912,"Good solid food.  I enjoy lunch here at least once a week.    If you are in the Cummins Station area get lunch here.   Good food, good service."
913,Tried the char grilled oysters and they were excellent.  The bartender recommended them and she was spot on with that suggestion.  The creole gumbo was good too.  It had a nice little kick of spiciness to it. The bread pudding was an excellent finish for the meal.  If you are on bourbon street this is a good choice for some place to stop and eat.
914,"I'm not gonna lie, i consider myself somewhat of a breakfast connoisseur. I'm not saying anybody else considers me this, I'm pretty sure its just me. But regardless of the details i travel long, far, and wide for a good breakfast. My next stop on this adventure was Skyway Jack's, now this isn't the original Skyway, ill make my way to that one at some point. But this one was closer to work and i decided to shoot over and see what all the hype was about. And from my visit the hype was well deserved. Now there were a couple of glitches when i got there, they were down a waitress so one poor soul was stuck working the whole room, and the service suffered because of it. Mainly my omelet came luke warm. I was dissapointed but i took the situation into consideration and decided to give them a pass. When i dug in i was extremely pleased. HOME FRIES, get the HOME FRIES. This is what home fries are suppost to taste like, not bland, and tasteless. These ppl do it right, the omelet was delicious aswell, the hash was good. Was dissapointed at the quality of the biscuit, but aside from that everything was pretty wonderful. Now its not at the level of Kissin Cuzzins, or Frog Pond. Who at the moment i consider the mecca's of Pinellas County breakfast. But its just a notch below. 4 stars for Skyway, def worth checking out. They also have some cheaper breakfast options for those not wanting to spend $7 on an omelet. We can't all be high rollers like me.........lol"
915,"I really liked the food. Our server was a bit uninformed of the menu, but she was nice. It's a beautiful spot with a great outside seating area. Will definitely be back to try more items from their menu. I overheard the owner telling another table that they grind up their own meat to make hamburger in house. That sounds good!"
916,Great place...great atmosphere...great food BUT not good for groups...waiter would not split the bill for a group of 10....very inconvenient...
917,"Been looking for a better breakfast place for awhile now - where the food is good and you don't wait an hour to get in. This place hit the spot on all fronts. It's quiet, and small - maybe 40 seater, with 12 of those seats outside. The menu isn't huge but that's okay. They make up for it by ensuring it's fresh, cooked to order and really tasty. We tried some regular menu standards - breakfast sandwich and a chicken fried steak - in both cases, got far more (quality-wise) than we were expecting. I'll be back to try the brunch specials, and the weekend dinner service looks pretty good, too."
918,Best Mexican we have found in Boise after looking for good Mexican food for a long time. Give it a try.
919,Great little local diner. Food was all very fresh and well prepared and if the Hollandaise was from a packet it fooled me! Much better then the mediocre joint just down the street with the prime location.
920,We thoroughly enjoyed this place. It has a great atmosphere and a great menu. The mushroom soup was amazing and the pizza sauce rocks. :)
921,"I hate Delco pizza.  Sorry, but I do.  I have 4 good places and Imperial is one of them.  Pizza is on the thin side with good sauce and cheese - I like to ask for mine ""well done.""  It's always ready to be picked up in 10 minutes!  Yes, it has a sandy bottom, but you can request yours to be without.  Nice guys who work there."
922,"Kung Fu Noodle has really authentic Chinese dishes and in general, they're really good. We had Dan Dan noodles, seaweed salad, the ""hamburger,"" and the beef ""burrito"". All of them were really tasty. 

A few things I didn't like:
The seaweed salad and burrito had A LOT of cilantro. I understand having a few for taste, but there were so much that I couldn't get the cilantro taste out of my mouth.
The ""hamburger"" bun was cold and hard. The taste wasn't bad, and I wish the kitchen could have toast it or grill it a bit. 
Service was not there yet. The girls were friendly enough, but they were so overwhelmed that they didn't bring us water or chopsticks. They could need further training or a more efficient system."
923,"I have been in a couple of times. I would skip their Pad Thai, I like it a particular way and either you got it or you don't.  What I do like is a lot of other items, like the Sweet Basil Salmon or the NomNom salad. I have also seen plenty of other dishes float by that I am willing to try.

There expansion seems to have paid off  and its now much more comfortable to sit and stay a bit."
924,"Love this neighborhood bakery/pizza joint.  The mushroom pizza is awesome. Once they warm it, it is perfect!  

I have not tried all their delicious sweets.  However, their classic birthday cake is so good! It's not too sweet and has jam in the layer which gives it such a nice taste!

The only compliant I have, I wish there was a sitting area.  I live not too far so it works.... The pizza stays warm :-)"
925,"Great flavors, solid service, only a few things lacking on the execution (a little bit of clumping in my grits, brussels sprouts a little too spicy for a breakfast dish)."
926,"Food was awesome! Some of the best brunch food I've ever had. Comfortable chairs and good atmosphere. Their coffee is amazing and you can order it while you wait! Lost a star because I witnessed a guy who works there be a complete jerk to a customer. I'm not a ""customer service"" person and don't really care if people are rude, but this guy was ridiculous. Besides that, everyone else was cool and the food was fantastic."
927,"For food truck food this place is hit or miss.  They end up outside Ms. Mae's a lot.  Have had the pig sandwich, the bacon barbecue burger and the crawfish mac and cheese.  Some is more delicious than others but a good options for the late night crowd."
928,Breath of fresh air in an area with a dearth of good pizza joints.  Great pizza and love the rock-n-roll atmosphere.  Can do without the long wait to sit but that's what happens when you're one of 4 places in the east-Tampa suburbs that can actually make an edible pizza.
929,"I live near here so location is a big part of why I stopped in my first time.  I'm not much of a soccer fan, or an ""English Pub"" type person, so normally I would have looked it over.  However I was pleasantly surprised when a friend and I had lunch there.  The food is really good!  I had a BLT - made with rasher bacon on a baguette, it is a substantial sandwich, and the homemade potato chips were great.  With a beer menu that would make even the most pretentious beer snob happy, you really can't go wrong for a nice leisurely afternoon lunch.  The patio out back is nice, too.
I can't say how it is late night - although it is packed every time I walk past it!"
930,"Great pizza, first off. Can't go wrong with the cheese steaks and the onion rings are nothing to laugh at. I get stuck on those things, but i want to order more! Delivery is good and timely, and the food is always nice."
931,"I am a Hoosier native but lived in Portland for 6 years and as soon as I stepped foot in Libertine I was like oooooooo Portland.  It was love at first sight.  

Our group stood at one of the communal ""waiting tables"".  It would have been nice to sit but we only stayed for a drink apiece, so it wasn't that bad.  Our waiter was good but there was an issue with their computer/credit card machine, so there was a delay in getting our check taken care of. 

I had the screw & bolt which was nice.  I tried my friend's sharpshooter, which was amazing and on a return trip this is what I will order.  

If I lived in Indy this would be my spot; I am happy I am in Bloomington because I might be here way too often.  I look forward to trying more cocktails and the food."
932,"Good food, traditional, nice little bar, large portions, and friendly service. Give them a look."
933,"I came here after recommendations from two different people.  The lady who waited on us was kind & wasn't impatient since it took me awhile to decide what to get.  We ordered brisket & pulled chicken. The brisket is pretty good & tender, however it had a bit of fat on it which I think is disgusting.  The pulled chicken was so delicious I almost slapped someone. The chicken was also smoked."
934,"I visited Iris in the French Quarter. It's a beautiful little place. The host and the waitstaff were attentive and professional. I had pork loin wrapped in bacon, and it was very good. My dessert, which involved salted caramel ice cream, was out of this world. Overall, a sweet night out."
935,"So I love spicy food.  At most places,  I load on the hot sauce.  So I assumed when I got the arroz con pollo with chicken, rice, and mexican sauage (which was delicious) that it wouldn't be spicy enough.  I so stupidly didn't even taste it and asked for some hot sauce, which they brought me in a dish.  It looked like Franks Red Hot, so I dumped it on.  Big mistake.  The hot sauce was SO SPICY (which unbeknownst to me, they charged me $1 for).  It was so hot that I downed 5 glasses of water, had tears in my eyes, and couldn't finish the rest of my meal.  On the plus side, I was stuffed from water and hence, didn't overeat!

The service here is really fantastic.  The server was so friendly and kept our water glasses filled.  We had a groupon ($15 for $30) and although it didn't say it on the groupon, the server told us that it came with a free dessert!  We got the crepes with bananas, caramel, and fresh berries which was tasty.   You also get free chips and tomatillo sauce, which was great.  The place is BYO, takes credit cards, and they offer different margarita mixes w/ your booze.  They have a private room upstairs which is great to reserve for large groups."
936,Yummy food and fair prices for the Montecito area! Stopped by after a hike and enjoyed a glass of wine and veggie salad. Good service. Great ambiance.
937,"My friend and I went for a late dinner. Very nice, music was play as a background so we could actually talk. Our server was very pleasant and fast. We both had the NY strip and were both very pleased. Will return."
938,"I've been to dmitris a few times and their food has never disappointed. It is authentic and fish is always fresh. Their food is hands down five stars. I am giving them four stars only because they require you to place your appetizers and main dishes at the same time but do not always allow for adequate time between courses. I don't mind placing orders for both at the same time, but they should definitely plan out the timing a little better. Other than than, dmitris is a great byob in queen village."
939,"Good breakfast. Pancakes were nice and fluffy. Cinnamon roll was awesome. 

Denver omlette was ok. Hashbrowns we're just ok, as well. 

Stick to the carbs here!"
940,The pizza was awesome I really liked the dough.. it was so good. I gave it a 4 star because I didn't care for the hot wings. They had some sort of dry rub on them and not a sauce. I was literally burping up all the spices from it. Definitely would go back for the pizza though!!
941,Cool place for coffee. Their crepes were ok. They have pretty good baked goods. Tried their mint iced tea which was refreshing. They can offer gluten free food which is not mentioned on the menu so you need to ask for it. I think the whole setup was pretty cool and would def go back.
942,"We mosied over here after a trip to the Broad Ripple Farmers Market on a Saturday afternoon. I'm not typically a fan of traditional Mexican food but it just sounded really good at the time, and I was looking forward to a hearty breakfast.

I ordered the breakfast quesadilla, which was fantastic. It was stuffed with eggs, potatoes, peppers, and tons of flavor! It all came with a side of rice and refried beans. Everything that came out of the kitchen looked awesome.

Not to mention, it was very affordable for the generous portions. I will definitely be back to try lunch sometime soon!"
943,"Holy pink and sparkles Batman! This place is super decked out in all thing cake bling. Great atmosphere for girls night out based on all the groups in their tonight. Saving grace for men? The cake was delicious. A bit pricy at $12.50/slice, but perfect for a special occasion. My wife and I stopped in for anniversary dessert tonight."
944,"in out, in out every busy place has its methods just indicate on the board which seating your pref is.  sounds like fast food or my first coitus experience.  sure its the pier 39, long wharf, alaskan way of SB, but a tourist has got to eat

bisque and lobster tacos? o miss molly, good golly

between the wait, good company, fresh food and postcard views i forgot if the service was any good.  it wasnt bad but then again you coulda punched me in the face as i was enjoyin myself that much"
945,"Awesome brunch. About $35 for unlimited mimosas and Buffett. Buffett is on point with a full seafood bar (ahi tuna, crab legs, peel-n-eat shrimp, smoked salmon and more). Limited tapas style menu to order even more goodies from. I recommend you order the bananas foster over the Belgian waffles off the tapas menu: phenomenal!  And if the food and drinks don't sell you, the view and service should. Dining room has windows lining the back wall so you have a stellar view of the bay while you're dining. Our server, Jade was superb. I don't think my mimosa glass was ever empty!"
946,"The food has always been good. Love the BLT. 
The potato skins were very good too. 
It's very roomy and great for large parties."
947,"This was the first coffee shop I visited in Philly (trying to branch out from Starbucks) and I wasn't disappointed!

The atmosphere is my favorite! There is plenty of room and plenty of tables to sip your coffee or pull out books to study (they offer free wifi). The shrubbery at the front of the door adds to the charm and makes you feel like it is a secret spot (haha). As a plus, the bathrooms are also very nice and clean!

The staff is super great ! Quick to take orders and whip them up.  I saw them walking around cleaning multiple times.

I ordered a pumpkin spice latte with almond milk.  It was very good! It didn't have a strong pumpkin flavor with lots of spice which some people don't like. A little pricey in my opinion around $5 for a small but that's usually how much lattes are anyways elsewhere.  

All in all, I really enjoyed Good Karma and can't wait to go back, grab a coffee and study!"
948,"I had the best dish I've ever had in New Orleans here, and it was even on a Sunday night.  The BBQ Gulf Shrimp was just absolutely fantastic.  I had a couple of errors with the waiter and the bar, but the food was just great.  The Tuna Two Ways appetizer was highly recommended by my girlfriend and I hardly had a chance to have any, given how good it was (and how she guarded it).
Again, the BBQ Gulf Shrimp was simply the best thing I've ever eaten in New Orleans.  I've eaten in a number of places there, but that dish was by far the best dish ever for me there."
949,"Awesome food and beer, best craft beer in Tucson! The tequila cilantro wings are a must with a Barrio Blonde."
950,This is the best ewing has to offer. Food is good and prices are reasonable. They need a larger appetizer selection.  Sals is our go to place when we are not sure where to go. Service is good but it is obvious that some of the girls smoke during their shift. That's a bit nasty. Over all a really good restaurant.
951,Very unique pizza topping combinations--everything from your average pepperoni and cheese to Thai peanut shrimp and Buffalo chicken. Plenty of TVs and beer for sports fans.
952,"P Chart:

Place: 4
Really good looking French country feel but not over done. They also have a great patio which is perfect on nice days. Good for a casual date

People: 4
Nice, quick and attentive. Waiter came through with a custom choice off the menu during a busy breakfast rush

Provisions: 5
Food was terrific. Very fresh and flavorful eggs bene was killer and was the grass fed  silver burger. Nothing here disappoints. 

Price: 5
Great food at a reasonable rate. Tough to find this quality at this price. 

Performance: 5 
Get the bacon!  With so little choice for great food on the main line this one ranks among the best for great semi casual food. You will be very pleased and will return"
953,"Great music, AMAZING, most comprehensive bourbon list anywhere in the city, with the nicest, most knowledgable bar tenders ever.  I did not have a chance to eat there - we can later at night for drinks and the music (honky tonk / rockabilly amazingness).  I love the interior, total retro cowgirl."
954,"Non food things: Friendly, attentive service. New, clean space. Lots of seating.  
Food things: Delicious tofu bao, delicious bubble tea, huge portions. Tofu with brown sauce came with vegetables and rice and was good but I wish I had ordered something with a bit more punch. Might try something spicy next time, or the tofu with bok choy.
Update: Sesame tofu and sautéed green beans are great, really flavorful especially for vegetarian options. The Taiwanese rice noodles were good, a little less flavorful than I had hoped but they were much better leftover the next day. Still need to try the scallion pancakes!"
955,"Better cookies!!!  Try the Chinese ""Jewish Deli"" cookies.
Very good cakes - but priced a bit high.  Need 48 hours notice for large cakes.

A good place to know about for sure!"
956,"so, my husband and i had a GC here... and we were pleasantly surprised about the whole evening... they let us bring our dog, and opened the back patio for us.... when we arrived there was a lone table with a white table cloth and candle gleaming... it was like we had our own private dinner with waiter service. the lettuce wraps were divine. my husband enjoyed his wine. and it was truly special and unique. Our only qualm is the quality of the dessert menu. we couldn't find anything on there we wanted.  wah.  otherwise. it was great."
957,"So I've done takeout from here twice. The first time I did the baked pork chop with rice, and was not excited. It was undoubtedly good, but not really what I was after. The crazy part is that I was eating leftovers for two days after - which was impressive. 

The second takeout order (last night) was excellent. It was water spinach, mango shrimp, and the seafood with vermicelli noodles and curry. The curry was very light, but the seafood was abundant and the mango shrimp was amazing. They also threw in a soup unsure of what it was (pork, corn, carrots) that was really tasty. Again - the leftovers from this order lastest for another two meals. 

I think I've found my go-to chinese takeout."
958,"I have not been here in years, everybody who knows food in Tucson has either been here or at least heard about it.  My memory was the food was amazing but the atmosphere was a little too claustrophobic grandmas french parlor (reminded me of some old school places i went to in France and Belgium).  What I experienced this time was mouth watering, buttery rich satisfying impeccable dishes, as well as a cleaner more updated venue.  It was packed for a weeknight, and when you go there you will know why.  This is a true Tucson gem!"
959,I've never been a huge fan of this place but my husband likes it. We went today for a late lunch and I got the hummus and pita for an app and the tossed Greek salad. The hummus was really yummy and the salad was very fresh and was a large serving. I couldn't finish it all so I took it home for tomorrow. Next time he wants to come here I know what I'll be getting - the tossed Greek salad!
960,"Best coffee in philadelphia located in a no-frills cafe. In fact, there isn't even a menu. A small selection of pastries and caffeinated drinks. But definitely come here for the coffee, smooth and well-priced."
961,Excellent amount of food with their early bird specials from 2-5pm. Food was average at best. People were friendly and everything was clean. Prices were pretty good
962,"Went back to The Fat Ham last week and it is still amazing.  Consistent, delicious, and priced right.  Still no cookie dessert but glad it isn't featured on the updated website.  The Road Trip short film was very good! Kevin, the next time you are in Atlanta, must try Star Provisions cold fried chicken and 7 Lamps' mussels. Glad to have you in University City, Mr. Sbraga."
963,My mom and I love this place oh and my step dad comes here almost every day. I love their soft shell crab sandwich and I am just in love with their fried pickles. The sauce that comes with the fried pickles is just amazing it has just a hint of horseradish in it. just makes it so much better than the rest. The only thing I don't like is the place is so small and so packed and when it's raining and cold you have to wait under the awning or in your car but you can't hear when it's your turn to be seated
964,A consistently wonderful venue for any occasion!  Bob Menendez is a class act and hires excellent folks to fulfill your every wish.  The food is superb!
965,"Great Tacos. Cozy atmosphere. They have happy hour and taco Thursdays. Staff are friendly. Affordable. I think
I'll be a frequent visitor."
966,"Captn Bill's kitchen is a typical beach bar grub spot. We had the charred oysters, crab cake sandwich and lobster bisque. Oysters good, lobster bisque good but the crab cake sandwich not so good. The potatoes and slaw were the side were bland. Drinks were decent priced. Server was great. Place is a must try if your in a beachie kinda mood for grub"
967,Loved our family dinner here just before Christmas. It's a cozy space and the service is fantastic. I can see why it's hard to get a reservation!  Great draft list - it's rare to see Chimay plus a ton of local brews. The wine list was also fairly expansive. The drunken mussels were delicious - the broth was incredible and I appreciated the toast to soak it up! I had the crab stuffed salmon for an entree. The crust was great and the portion was the perfect size. The mashed potatoes and broccolini were a nice complement.  I wish I had more room for dessert! But the complimentary Limoncello shot at the end was a nice touch.
968,"Price is intimidating but worth it! 
Owner is an awesome human. 
Bartender was fantastic!"
969,"Fantastic little BYOB! The Antipasto Salad and Gnocchi were excellent. Contrary to some other reviews about the crowded seating, I thought it was rather spacious. There are other BYOB's in Philadelphia that are much smaller. I will be back here again soon."
970,"Post PIC-Nic, we decided to continue our Tasting Society Membership adventures at Books and Brews in Zionsville.  We arrived at 8:45pm, and knew they would be closing at 10.  

I've loved the concept of B&B since I heard about it - literary favorites transformed into delicious food and drink options is a super creative approach.  I also like that this is a family friendly environment, with fun drawing of Shakespeare on the wall and tons of board games to choose from.

Using our Membership, we decided to go for a flight of 4 beers each since we were not familiar with their goods.  Between the 8 different options, the only one I'd say I wouldn't order again was the Ice and Fire Sour - they have a series of them and I'm sure the others were great, but this specific one was an interesting Scotch Ale that was soured.  Our server said that ""it packs a punch"" and she wasn't kidding - incredibly rich and I would love the Sour Scotch if it was split into a Sour and a Scotch Ale.  The SO enjoyed her Blonde and Hefe the most, and if it had been a bit earlier in the night we might have stayed for a few more drinks.  

Table service was a great touch, and they offer select bombers, cans, and growler fills to go in addition to a nice little selection of merchandise.  We didn't venture upstairs but it seems like a great space that can accommodate large groups and have lively atmosphere.  They had live acoustic music last night, but things were dying down a bit by the time we got there (he was great! Bring him back!).  

Note - if you live in the area, B&B has a Mug Club where they do discount fill nights in cute ceramic pint glasses.  I almost bought one to take home."
971,"Visiting the area so found this place via Yelp. Very busy, limited parking but we got lucky somebody was leaving. Also got the last table, however there were spots at the bar. I ordered breakfast quesadilla and home fries. Very good. Coffee good too. My husband got the biscuit and gravy platter and loaded home fries and my son got the Bradley's breakfast sandwich. Both said their food was good. 

Service was quick and friendly. If we are in the area again we would return."
972,"A great meal that my family really enjoyed!  You can tell that the management and the staff here really care about delivering an exceptional dining experience!  Steaks were seasoned perfectly and grilled exactly how we asked.  They have a fun Tuesday night kids theme ($1.99 kids meal with a drink -what a deal!) with a mascot roaming the restaurant, face painting and a ice cream topping bar.  Better get there early to get a table as the crowd waiting as we left tells me the word's out about this great family restaurant!  In a sea of horrific chains Texas Roadhouse in Sicklerville is head and shoulders above the rest!"
973,"Tonight was our first time at Tired Hands. We came in for Taco Monday, which means $2 off every taco on the menu & half-price pints of HopHands and SaisonHands. The tacos & the beers (we tried Hop, Saison, Helles Other People, Cause & Concern, and Paper Mansions) were all incredible. I do wish that the tortillas used for the tacos has been warmed, instead of just filled, but tacos were still good nonetheless. Service was super friendly as well. Wish we lived closer so this place could become one of our regular spots, but we'll definitely be back soon!"
974,"Finally an authentic Mexican taqueria! You know you're in the right place when it's packed with the locals. Hard to get a table on the weekends. Menu is small, prices are average, the tacos are packed with meat, but the star here are the handmade corn tortillas. Walking into this place I felt like I was back in Mexico visiting family. I would've given them 5 stars but one of the ladies there was rude when I asked for a fork. She said,""they're tacos. You don't eat them with a fork."" Well duh, but I use it to pick up all the meat that spills out of the taco. Whatever. Not a fancy place but food is good."
975,"I'd like to begin by praising the venue's name, which I think is pretty clever given the location and all.

All right, moving on, the highlight for me was being able to walk into the restaurant after 11pm, when the restaurant closes at midnight, after I had just seen a concert across the street at The Pageant and having the server / bartender look me dead in the eyes, not even flinch and say, ""Sure you can order food, have a seat. Do you want a beer?""

Yes. Yes I do.

Pizza-wise they only serve thin crust or Chicago-style. I'm not a huge thin crust fan so I went with the Chicago. It hit the spot. So did the couple of St. Louis brews I drank to wash it down.

Good food. Great hospitality. I can't recommend them enough."
976,"This is just some seriously authentic Mexican food.

I found out about this place from my boss who was raving about the horchata. They make it fresh. It's the kind of horchata that you have to keep stirring to keep it together. Definitely the best I've ever had.

The tacos are so well made. The meat is very tender and all the pickled veggies with fresh corn tortillas make for a wonderful, tasty combination.

You basically feel as though you are in Mexico here. From the outside to the inside it is very authentic. I didn't try the pico but it seems very unique."
977,"My first time ever to this diner on a weekday. As soon as I entered in this diner it felt like entering in someone's home. Its a cozy diner with very friendly servers. There are so many good diners in the area and this one is def one of the finest. The serving sizes are huge. The omelettes are great, I didn't try anything sweet so can't say how were the pancakes or French toasts. But the menu has so many different options and they all looked very good specially the sandwiches. I had an egg Benedict which was ok, nothing wrong with it but nothing great either, portion size was huge. My wife had an omelette with onions and American cheese which was very good ( again I liked her order better than mine lol). You pay the bill at the counter after you finish eating . I would go back again and would try other things on the menu."
978,"My family and I were visiting from CA and it was our first time at a Chick fil a. We ordered the spicy chicken, original chicken, chicken nuggets, strips, fries, and had a cookies and cream shake. Food was great, we loved the sauces. The only down point was the service. I asked the guy if there were free refills on the soda and he yes and the staff would be walking around. Every time I asked for a refill I'd get a ""surprised or annoyed"" look. It wasn't busy and I didn't understand why they just didn't put the fountain machines in the lobby like a normal restaurant?"
979,"I came here on business, the people were great. The food was excellent, my only issue was the ambient music was good but drowned out by people singing Kareoke or live entertainment in the bar...between the two musics going it sounded like a mish mash where you couldnt enjoy one or the other.  I informed the owner and he was very accomodating and turned down the music in the main restaurant in order to alleviate the noise attenuation."
980,"Pulling up to the burg you might think it's a weird spot for a diner- it's a small strip mall with a barber and a real estate agent but it's worth the visit. 

The owner Bill is there just about every day- he takes his time to greet and thank every table.  His mom is usually there to greet and fill your coffee.  They all, including the servers, try to always remember you and your favorites.

My personal favorite is the hungry Greek.  My family and I typically all order the combo. For around $10 you get 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 meat of your choice, potato or grits and toast. The pancakes are easily the best in St Pete! They have a sweetness to them, maybe vanilla, that just kicks them up a notch. 

Always check the chalkboards for their specials, they usually will have a fun pancake like strawberry cheesecake or peanut butter cup, as well as a skillet or breakfast burrito option.

If you go for lunch- get the burger.  Perfectly seasoned with fresh cut fries."
981,"A gem of a find when were tired of the same old restaurants in the area. We never heard of this place before. They have a nice selection of gluten free options. The pizza was very good. When ordering the pasta, you get salad and a huge basket of rolls (plain or garlic). The pomodoro has a little kick but all in all everything was delicious and I highly recommend this place."
982,Place is on the edge of the French Quarter in more ways than one. But the coffee was good and a cool coffee shop.
983,"I recently took my Father to The Love to celebrate his birthday and Father's Day! When I made my reservation, I made a note of those celebrations and upon being greeted by the hostess that was the first thing they addressed with my sweet Papa! 

The ambience is really hip, and it's a fairly intimate setting. We were seated in their booth style cushioned seats which was very comfortable. I am a booth girl all the way!

I ordered he shrimp and grits with baby buttermilk biscuits and my Dad ordered the catfish and hush puppies in his true southern style. Can we talk about those biscuits?! So delicious. Words cannot express why I ate 5 of them in one sitting. The shrimp and grits were great, and that's coming from someone who NEVER eats grits. My Dad was less impressed with the catfish and hush puppies, but that's coming from someone who was born and raised in the South. I tried the hush puppies as well and they paled in comparison to the biscuits. 

Our server was very sweet and fairly attentive given the packed restaurant. For the total experience I would return. If I want truly amazing southern food (despite their menu) I would go elsewhere."
984,"We arrived in New Orleans on Christmas night ,just before 8:00 pm -- the first time, we realized, we've ever landed at night -- and quickly (I've *never* seen so little traffic on I-10!) made it to our hotel, the Le Meridien.¹

We actually arrived at Lüke for dinner a bit early, in terms of our reservation, but it was Christmas night and being seated early wasn't a problem. Lüke, however, can itself have its share of problems .

-- The front room can be (and often is) on the loud side, so much so that as a party of five at a rectangular table, it became difficult to hear. This is, of course, systemic and doesn't change. (The back room is quieter.)

-- Bring Christmas night, I have to say both the kitchen and service were a bit ""off,"" but only in terms of timing -- NOT in terms of food (see below). Certain things came out almost too quickly; other things seemed to take forever. For example, Lüke offered two types of oysters, and we ordered six of one, and a dozen of the other. The order of six came in a relatively timely fashion, but the 12 seemingly took forever, arriving long after the (cooked) appetizers were finished, and just before the entrées. It also took a (relatively) long time to get the wine we ordered to accompany our entrées. This, however, is more appropriately chalked up to Xmas night, rather than being ""the norm"" in our experience.

That said, the food was, as always, wonderful and delicious! The rabbit & chicken liver pate was silky smooth and satisfying; the brussels sprouts crispy and tasty; the crabmeat maison flavorful and tangy. The Drum was perfect, as were the shrimp & grits and the moules frites.

Lüke remains, for us, one of those places you can count on for good food and good drinks. It may not be our favorite place in New Orleans, but it always satisfies.

¹ Formerly the Hotel New Orleans, formerly the W Downtown -- I guess it depends upon what day of the week it is."
985,"My husband and I have dined at Ryan Christopher's on several different occasions. Every time we leave, we're stuffed and more importantly satisfied. 

Although we've never dined here for dinner the breakfast and lunch options are great. They have something for everyone from waffle egg sandwiches, chocolate chip pancakes, to poached pear salads and Thai chicken wraps. Everything we've tried has been tasty.  

The restaurant has expanded their seating area. They removed the bar/ griddle area and have introduced a larger seating area. In the warmer months you can done outside. 

I'm giving it a 4 because the service, although friendly, is not always attentive."
986,The reviews did not disappoint. The chargrilled oysters were the BEST!!!! Shrimp po boy fried fish po boy seasoned and fried to perfection. Ask for Shirley. Even though she is a Met fan we won't hold that against her. She is an excellent server. Will be back.
987,"Great food! The wait was a bit long, and their wait list process is a bit confusing. But other than that it was nice, friendly, and quick service. And the food was fantastic."
988,"Either ate or had drinks here a few times over the summer as my office was just upstairs.  I'm not a vegetarian, but the Goodness wrap is a knockout.  I also greatly enjoyed the chili I had here, though it was a special so I'm not sure how often it comes around.  I'm not really into the hipster vibe of the staff, but I never had any service problems and that's what is most important.  

I definitely don't live or die by The Bricks but it's a place I would suggest if you're ever in Ybor City."
989,"Greeted at the door by a pleasant server.  Ample seating.  Tables turn over quickly.  Loud music. Hip vibe.   Young crowd.  Cheap eats.  $8 wines and a pretty decent beer selection.   Pizza served within 5 minutes!  Absolutely fabulous!  Nice thin crust with fresh ingredients.  Didn't expect fresh tasty basil in Philadelphia in 9° weather (bit of a basil snob, I am).  Good mozzarella on our Margherita pie.  Hubby had the special Salumente Picante pizza slice and it was tasty.  Nothing to scream home to mama about but a nice spot with a good slice.  Bravo."
990,"Awesome cafe!  My friends and I were in town for Mardi Gras in 2011 and stumbled upon this gem while wandering around looking for lunch.  I had the Fleur de Lis Panini and it was delicious.  Also, the bathroom is ridiculously nice; it had a TV playing AMC!"
991,The atmosphere is awesome. The food is delicious. Just a tad overpriced in my opinion. But...that hasn't stopped me from eating there....several times. :)
992,"Food is very good here and it's basically unlimited, so you must go hungry and plan to spend a lot of time - I mean hours - to make the price worth it per person. 

The banchan assortment needs work, but more on that in a moment. 

I found it a little weird to have kbbq and chinese style hot pot at the same place,  BUT this IS Pinellas county so variety is pretty limited in these food genres, so I consider it a smart move on the owners part. 

You get the option to have both hot pot and kbbq together or you can do them separately. We tried them both since it was our first visit, but wouldn't do them together again as they just don't pair well in one sitting. 

Both food styles are your traditional setup and ingredients, and it's completely self service.  The only thing staff will bring you is whatever meats, menu items and drinks you order.  You cook everything and get all your own condiments and banchan from the condiment bar. If you are seated toward the back, it's a tad inconvenient because there are no serving trays, only small plates and bowls so you make a lot of trips. 

The table grills and hotpots are all very safe. Induction heat and no open flames. Smart. You control your own grill temps too. Countless places I've been for kbbq normally will have staff come tend your grill and deliver your bancahn dishes, but here its ALL you. 

The hotpot was pretty so-so to average, so I focused mostly on the kbbq. 

The food and marinades are good quality and fresh with a huge assortment of meats and raw vegetables to cook, but the banchan variety is very very limited to a few pickled items and about 3 types of kimchis. I'm accustomed to a much wider variety of banchan, which is always my favorite part of kbbq. Was kind of disappointed in that area. 

The atmosphere is pretty hip, clean, and dark. Nicely decorated for a long stay, and the staff was very friendly."
993,"All-around nice place. No ""wow"" factor but solid service, good food and nice ambience. We were a party of 6 and tho it was a little ""strained"" hearing each other, that's often expected with parties more than 4. Solid restaurant; tho there are others we'd choose."
994,I tried the hamburger via the Bartenders suggestion and it was very tasty indeed!  I wouldn't say this place was extraordinary in any aspects but it was tasty and I didn't have any service issues.
995,"This place is fast and very reasonably priced. Their take-out portions are small, but only four or five bucks depending on what you get, so you can try a bunch of things without spending too much money. You can also order rice and nan in individual protions so you get just the right amont. 

Ordering online is easy too."
996,"It doesn't strike me as very authentic but you get a ton of (tasty) food for very little money. I ordered a Horchata and it was insanely huge, maybe 1/4 a gallon."
997,"I've become a fan of Sher-e Punjab over the last couple years despite agreeing with some of the same criticisms that have been voiced here by others.

The overpriced naan and charging for rice are a turn-off. Especially the rice. You may as well charge for ice in my water.

I almost did a spit-take when I read Brooke's comment on the decor - so ridiculously true. The place is gaudy, but no more so than so many of your typical Asian-immigrant businesses. Just goes with the territory, like the golden Maneki Neko (beckoning cat), hookahs, fez's, etc.

But the main thing is the food, and the food is good - really good - really, really good. Their Vindaloo is spicy deliciousness, the okra dish (Bhindi Masala) is amazing, and the Biryani is so rich.

I've found my favorite way to experience Sher-e Punjab is either to get it takeout or have Delicious Deliveries bring it to me. Throw a pot of rice on when you order and you'll be ready to go by the time it gets there."
998,Extremely friendly with great service. Extra large interior for a waffle house with padded backs in the booths. Will happily return.
999,"I was on my way to Pho & Beyond with my mom when I was like, ""Hey do you want to try 'La Fusion' instead?"" So we gave it a shot. I gave it a 4 star for one reason: Crispy Duck. It was phenomenal. I asked for both sauces (thai curry / raspberry sauce) on the side - I definitely prefer the thai curry sauce while my mom mixed both sauces together. The duck was seriously cooked to perfection. 

We also had the shrimp pad thai - it was okay - it wasn't great but it wasn't bad. It's pad thai  - I think the $18 price is a bit much for pad thai. 

The decor is really nice inside and the server was pleasant. I saw on the outside that there was a 2 course special - but the server never explained it to us or brought it up as an option.  It's all good though. 

Cons: I think it's a bit overpriced given it's location. If we were in the city it would make sense, but not at Willow Grove. 

Lack of parking - maybe like 6 or 7 spots? We parked at the Pho & beyond shopping complex - and walked over. I think they should add another door near the back of their restaurant (just a suggestion).  If they have a deal with the bank to park there...they should have a clear, huge sign that parking is allowed at the bank after a certain time. 

I don't know if it is lack of parking, the weekday, or the $$$, but it was really empty inside the restaurant at 7 p.m. on a Wednesday night. It was a bit awkward. 

The Olive Garden across the street was overflowing with people waiting outside. It was just awkward. Maybe they should have a groupon deal or something so more people can come to this place. 

Would I go back again? I think for the Crispy Duck - yes.

[Edit]: I received a message from a fellow yelper that on the Saturday they went, there was a 30-45 minute wait. Since I loved the Crispy Duck so much I've decided to have my birthday dinner there. Will keep you posted."
