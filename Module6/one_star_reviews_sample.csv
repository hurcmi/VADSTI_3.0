0,"Wish I had read the reviews before we stopped for dinner.  When we arrived there were only two other tables of patrons and a handful of people at the bar.   They promptly took our food order, but we waited 50 minutes for it to be delivered.   It was only a burger and a pork tenderloin sandwich.   Not sure why we didn't leave other than the fact we were watching football.  Food was just ok.

The people at the bar were so loud, offensive and obnoxious that I felt uncomfortable for an older couple that was dining.    What kind of management allows this kind of behavior?   

This place won't last."
1,"Literally, the worst Taco Bell I have ever been to. The restaurant is filthy, the service is awful, and they didn't make any of our order correctly, and really, how hard is that?  I won't be back and if I were you I would find a different place to go."
2,"Slow service with an attitude, filthy dining and restrooms. Figured the first time they were having a bad day. Because I was craving Taco Bell thought I would give this location a second shot. There were two customers in line ahead of me and after waiting ten minutes to order and looking around at the state of the place I should have walked out. Guess I'm a sucker for punishment. Take notice and get this place shaped up !"
3,"Rude, inattentive, uneducated and they always make you feel that you are bothering them. I have started using mobile order because it's one less idiot to deal within the chain. When they start making $15 an hour we will be ordering from kiosks and maybe dealing with one person."
4,"I stopped going this BK and usually avoid all BK. 
I don't know if all BK are like this one or is this location uniquely bad. Whenever you pass by you never see many cars so you get tricked into thinking that you could get in and out fast. When they do answer to take your order, its never friendly or welcoming. Once i thought i heard someone say ""Yea, what u want"" but i will give the benefit of the doubt i miss heard. Nothing i order is complicated or special request so you would think it wouldn't take long. It seems as if they don't start until you have paid, because they ask for me to pull around. I understand if they were busy or off hours or something reasonable, but no. You can hear them holding conversations, that if were management they would be fired on the spot. You get a sense of not being welcomed as if your inconveniencing them. Then after waiting, they bring your order to your car and say nothing. No sorry for the wait, or bla bla.
I have learned the hard way to not leave until you check your food to make sure its 100%. 9 out of 10 times my order is wrong in some way. Either something is missing or they ignored my request all together. 
You then decide is it worth the possible wait time and rude service or just take it and leave. 
The last time i left i swore to never go back.
If someone from management reads this, if you want to know why your store is dying. Look at your employees first, then quality control."
5,"Oh, Heck No! We ordered 2 pizzas tonight: one new hand tossed and one thin and crispy. And I do use the word crispy lightly. Both these pizzas were limp and soggy. When we lifted the pieces from the boxes the tips pointed straight down at the table--and not because of the weight of the ingredients. Those were just ordinary. But, this thin and ""crispy"" crust was very crispy on the very outer edge, but wallpaper paste everywhere else. The hand tossed is a new product and I thought maybe they just hadn't gotten it perfected yet. It also was soggy and did a nose-dive to the table when lifted. Unfortunately, it was already after nine pm when they arrived and we decided to just eat what we could and call it a night. But, I thought about it and decided that maybe they didn't know and if everyone was silent, they would lose business and people would have bad experiences. So, I called and spoke to David, who identified himself as the manager on duty. I told him we had gotten pizza and that I just wanted to give him some feedback. He was very nice, polite and pleasant. I liked him. Until. Until he said that he had pulled up my order and that there were 6 toppings on one pizza and 9 toppings on the other pizza and so with so many toppings, it's hard for them to know how long to cook the pizzas. I thought about that a second and asked, ""so it's my fault for ordering too many toppings""? He said no and then explained again that with that many toppings it's too hard to judge how long to cook the pizzas. I told him then it should say on the website (I ordered online) that they don't recommend more than however-many toppings. He explained the problem to me again and I told him Dominos can cook a crispy pizza crust perfectly--and do a pretty good hand tossed, too. I said maybe I should call them and find out how to do it and call him back and tell him. I mean, how ridiculous! I asked for nothing comped, nothing like that. I was just giving the feedback and ended up being a bit flip with him and sitting here typing this because I'm mad instead of sleeping. With delivery and tip, I paid $30 for food that was barely eaten and will probably be thrown away in a few days. It'll dry out in the refrigerator, so maybe I can have it crispy after all. What idiocy.

I told him the Yelp review would be up in about an hour, so ""Hi, David!"" and I contacted corporate, too."
6,ive tried going here four times with no success because the drive tru takes so long that i have pulled away every single time. great job idiots!
7,"The owner of Popeyes used to send his mother to the drive thru once a week and report irregularities.  This bk must be a corporate store because of corporate like employees serving a human population.
Soggy (or oil tainted) tater tots, but everything else is made fresh.  That means EVERY customer has to ""please pull around because they are so fresh they are just coming out of the oven"".   Then they forget caramel in a specialty coffee, or a drink that goes with the combo they are holding.  Breakfast is a disorganized mess.  Definitely not a place you want to go when you are in a hurry.  It's a slow food, or pull around & wait establishment....would not recommend to anyone for breakfast.  Maybe it was due to the Monday's????"
8,"Why does it say online. Open 24/7 everyday but, there always saying the store is closed at night. Even the drive thru is closed 3 days a week at night. Also the staff is ignorant. #BlackOwnedBusinesses"
9,"Stood in line (2nd in line) for 20 minutes one guy in front of me waiting on the cashier , the cashier was just standing there smiling taking the sweetest time ever possible I could have gotten to a log john silvers in Texas before he pressed a button on the register. The food was poorly made thrown on a plate and served after another 20 minutes of waiting. I could have went to the gulf and caught my own fish to filet them myself quicker than they threw  this ""fast food"" together. Fish wasn't the same as the LJS in goodlettsville before it shut down. The one in goodlettsville was the best one ever! There should be more of the around. Captain d's is a joke compared to LJS!"
10,"This has got to be the worst experience we've had in a very long time. First of all, they don't deliver to our home. But we were in the mood for stuffed crust, so we ordered online for pickup. We got our email confirmation for order complete time at 5:30, and I noticed one of our  pizzas was wrong so I called right away. The girl I spoke to on the phone confirmed she has changed it. So when my husband gets there at 5:35. the pizzas aren't even ready. And surprise, surprise the order is WRONG. There were only 2 people working, and he didn't want to wait. He gets home, and the pizzas are borderline cold, like they've been sitting there. It was just a horrible experience and will never order/eat at a Pizza Hut again. Bye, Felicia!"
11,"The two waiters/cooks were sitting down in the dining area when we arrived. Noticed there wasn't any else and that should have been a red flag. The waiter was loud and awkward. Their phone rang multiple times and they ignored it. They were out of tea, but brewed some. Noticed a lot of tables had not been wiped down. Others walked in and waited,  but left after not being acknowledged. Then noticed the section that was closed off awaiting vacuuming. Staff were loud about their job dissatisfaction. We should have left, but I was hungery. Brought out one pizza, no silverware or napkins. Had to ask for them specifinally. Food was okay. They finally answered the phone and talked with a customer who never received their order. Pepsi was off,  so they gave out litre bottles.  This was the strangest, most bizarre place I've ever visited. They lied to customers calling in about how busy they were and openly complained about customers. It was intriguing to watch, but never going to eat here ever again."
12,You get to wait 20 minutes even when first in line at the drive thru window. Now worth it - even of their fries are die-worthy!
13,"Really this should be Zero stars. I'm not sure how this particular location can be consistently bad for so long. I live not far from this location, but I will usually drive farther to another location because from top to bottom this location fails. Every once and a while, like today, I'll stop by and see if they were able to turn it around. Well, I'm sad to say that they still are awful. I'm really shocked that this location is able to stay in business this long. 
I went through the drive thru and ordered a KFC value meal. 15 minutes later I got my food. Apologies? Are you kidding? I had clearly inconvenienced the staff by being a paying customer. They essentially tossed me my food without saying even ""thank you"" or ""come again"". I drove away (my mistake) and noticed when I got home that my drink was wrong, I received no napkins and no plastic ware. 
Overall, this place has consistently the worst fast food staffing that I have ever seen. Who ever manages this location should be ashamed and consider another profession. Do yourself a favor and go to the Wendy's next door, they are consistently good."
14,"Even in the middle of lunchtime on a weekday, food is cold-old. With that odor associated with something that as waited too long, where flavor transmutes to an impatient attitude. You could maybe account for this by imagining the burger, fries, and fish sandwich had been prepared at some suburban McDonalds and then trucked over to this urban outlet to be re-heated and allow to age a bit. This is an insult to the neighborhood."
15,I'm really not sure how this location is still in business.  Staff is uninterested in actually helping you.  Food is ehhhhhh!  There are so many good places to eat.  This ain't one of them.
16,"This location is supposed to be open until 1 AM and I came up at 10 PM and it was closed. I think it's fair to mention that all of these other reviews are correct in saying that it will take you about 30 minutes to get your food every time you come here. The only reason that I came this time was because it's close to my house and I was hungry after working all day, but of course they weren't even open during their normal hours."
17,"Employees try to avoid eye contact in order to pretend you're not there. I waited 5 minutes at the counter only to have no one approach me to take my order. I departed letting them know that I would put in a complaint. No surprise, no one got back to me on my complaint."
18,I feel like you have to TRY to screw up orders as bad as they do. Not only that but we had an experience once when I was there with my 2 kids and 2 employees were screaming at each other. They were cussing and finally one left. I got her name and called corporate to complain- never heard back. Next time we went in (we always went before PSR on Wednesdays) that employee was there again. I can't believe she wasn't fired for screaming and cussing in front of kids!
19,This is the slowest drive through I have ever been in my entire life not sure how this survives why people continue to come back here
20,"I placed my order at 6:05 pm. It's now 8:25 pm. I have still not received my order. When I called the person that answered the phone he was extremely short and rushed me off the phone. No apology. No refund. Just extremely rude. I called them 4 times and two of the 4 times he put me on hold or hung up. I only selected this restaurant due to it saying a delivery time is 45 minutes. Customer service can and should go a long way to make any organization thrive. This company needs to figure out a plan of action to get this fixed or they will not last long. Even a simple courtesy call to say we are running behind would have gone a long way. I still am hopeful my food comes soon because I'm still hungry. If the food is good, I'll be sure to let you all know if and when it ever arrives."
21,"Worst experience ever! Not only did they not deliver my food, but they claimed they tried knocking... I never once heard them.. I called them back letting them know that I would no longer be wanting the food and to just forget it. The manager said it was complementary and that a driver was on his way.. 40 minutes later still no food.. Manager even stated that it was due to the ""idiots"" in their store.. never ordering from here again.. Domino's has never let me down.. should not have switched it up tonight."
22,Sat in the drive thru for over ten minutes as the only customer.  I never got my order taken even though I tried to get the attention of the drive thru worker.  I ended up just leaving.
23,I work 3rd shift and get off at 2am and there is very few places that are 24hrs. Twice in two nights i was denied a burger. They said the grills are down then i asked for milkshake they said milkshake machine is down. Then on a 3rd occasion i was served food but after i didn't get a response in drive thru i drove around and they were all outside smoking.  Im done with this place. People don't wanna work apparently at this time of night. They shouldn't be open 24hrs to waste people's time.
24,"Stopped in today for a quick bite and to use the restroom.  I hate to be negative but oh my god the lobby was dirty.  The men's restroom was out of order.  I ordered 1 burrito, I'm not kidding I waited over ten minutes for that burrito.  They weren't even busy come on Taco Bell.  Fix this this place was nasty, my next phone call will be to the Health Department EWWWW!!!!!"
25,"Worst Taco Bell I've ever been in and I know they are fast food and not some fancy place. Been several times. They never have any ice in the machine out front, and the beverages are flat or stale. The trash cans are running over and the service is slow. Won't be back.  I can only imagine how they prepare the food. Really don't want to think about that."
26,"This place sucks
Worse than Shenanigans

Food.....so so
Service.....Horrible
Management.....Clueless

New owner, same garbage"
27,"First time I ordered,they said it would be an hour wait,my husband called after an hour and 30 mins,they said our pizza was on its way. We waited another 45 minutes or so before calling again,they  apologized,gave it to us for free then finally delivered it. When we got it both pizzas were wrong and ice cold,since they were free we didn't call back. Today we decided to give them another chance,they said 2 hours this time so my husband called them back and said he would just pick them up. He went up there to pick them up and they said the driver was on his way to our house,my husband came home,then they called and said the driver came back to the store and we just told them to deliver it because he was already home,we waited about 40 minutes and they call again saying ""the driver broke down so we have to pick it up"". We just moved to the neighborhood so 2 out of 2 bad experiences is enough for me,never again will I waste my time ordering from this clueless location!"
28,"I LOVE LJS fish, & it's been ages since having some. So, yesterday evening we went here despite the reviews. We went with eyes wide open, knowing the service would suck. It did. Food was good, but waiting in line was forever as cashier cut up with employees & customers ahead of us, who were apparently family as we noted they didn't have to pay very much...finally a manager came up from the back & told dude to just clock out & leave if he was just going to cut up. He did. As I said, food was good...when we finally got it. Table & booth were almost adhesive with old grease, though. Nasty. Health inspection was noted to be a 98, but with the lack of cleanliness, I can't imagine how. Next time, I'll wait forever, but get it to go."
29,"I thought the first time I went there, they were just having a bad day.  So I returned a second time.  Never again!! The service is a joke...20 mins to get my order and it was wrong. The stupid leading the stupid.  Management should be ashamed for hiring the most incompetent people in Indianapolis.  One question for the employees... What are you going to do with your life if  you can't even make a taco???"
30,"Stood in line (2nd in line) for 20 minutes one guy in front of me waiting on the cashier , the cashier was just standing there smiling taking the sweetest time ever possible I could have gotten to a log john silvers in Texas before he pressed a button on the register.

The one in goodlettsville was the best one ever! There should be more of the around. Captain d's is a joke compared to LJS! 

8-16-17  , came back to try it out, same guy at the register taking his time to give me 3 dollars back, out of tartar sauce, fish is dry, how is this place still in business?, where is the GM for this place?.. they need new employees and tartar sauce."
31,This is one of the worst McDonalds on ever been to it's so dirty the food is horrible customer service is the pits it is one of the worst worst McDonald's ever been into very unsanitary don't eat here
32,"Continuously ** HORRIBLE SERVICE** They say its a training store, then some needs to train the trainers. Made a simple order no special request and still... could not get it right... 9:45 AM Sunday Morning... If at all possible GO SOMEWHERE ELSE"
33,Wow what can I say this kfc Taco Bell combo is the worst. I wanted some tacos to take home and they had no beef what in the world. None of the tables were clean. The workers were yelling while they were working. Just a bad place to eat.
34,I order delivery from this location now less and less     When I have ordered the last few times I have not received my gift cards or movie passes. My delivery last night included a steak Caesar where they threw the meat on the salad and then the dressing and croutons on top of it making the dressing slimy to hold and also how is this food safe?? I will let you judge by the picture if you would want to eat this.
35,"Wow! Not sure that I could add much more to what has been voiced in the prior reviews. I hear that the Sunday brunch is OK. However my experience in dining there for dinner was perhaps the worst ever. To recap, lousy food, horrible service, and an atmosphere that is ridiculous for a place serving food. The place should do everyone a favor and shut down the kitchen and make money off the drunk and obnoxious bar patrons. I wish that Yelp had a zero star rating."
36,"I am absolutely disgusted and will NEVER eat at Taco Bell after the experience I just had. I arrived home with my to-go order which included 3 tacos. Upon opening the 3rd taco I was stunned and sickened to find a BANDAID in the wrapping of my taco. And yes... I took multiple pictures. I tried to call the location but surprise surprise... no answer. 

NEVER AGAIN will I go near this place or Taco Bell in general for that matter."
37,I want to preface this with that I don't post many reviews but I felt the need to after tonight.. I started going to this location because of the elsmere subway was awful. The staff here are great and very helpful however after getting out of class and stopping at this location I witnessed a small bug which looked like a small roach crawling around fairly close to the food.. I would have rated this a 4 out of 5 normally but now this location will be added to my list of ones to avoid.
38,"Awful extremely salty food.  I order the same thing at every McDonald's I ever go to and for some reason the artisan chicken sandwich was extremely salty.  I asked called (which I almost never do with fast food joints), and spoke to a snippy female 'manager' and was told to stuff either bring the sandwich back - which I had fed to my dogs by this time.  No refund, no replacement.  The manager gave me 'corporate's' number to call.  I did and spoke to Dot.  After a lot of back and forth with Dot, who had said she was the owner, and then said she wasn't.  She claimed the manager was right, I said fine, keep the money I'll just write an online review.  Then she put me on hold to consult with the 'owner' and came back and offered me a refund if I could give her the precise time I could go back to the store.  I couldn't. So she offered coupons.  I said fine as long as they covered the artisan grilled chicken sandwich which is all I order from McDonald's.  Watch this space.  I will delete the review if I receive a satisfactory resolution."
39,"Like the others, I sat in their drive thru for 20 plus minutes. They truly don't give a crap about customers. Probably not the employees' fault, I'm sure it's just two in there..."
40,"The drive tru is under construction, but not inside, well it look the oppsite. They are not ready to take care of the customers. Poor customer services and dirty place. The beverage area is dirty.  The lids are all over the place. No straws. No ice in the dispensers, and the serving soda machine area is dirty. They do not have happy meal toys. I was told the only thing they have is whatever they get left from other times. 
The guy at the register has his headphones hanging from his ears and asking what I had order. The other employee just standing there. I looked inside my bag with food and no ketchup so I asked her for some and she slide a ketchup bin towards me. As I was walking towards the door I heard her tell the other employee thats why she does not put ketchup out for people to grab because they take everything. Well, thats why you should prepare the orders with everything it needs so customers do not interrupt your personal conversation."
41,Probably the worst sub I had here. The two ladies here are degrading the name of subway. They don't understand the offers which are written in English. I had a coupon which says any footlong sub for $5 but these uneducated ladies could not understand what it is and I have to pay the full price.
42,"They give new meaning to fast food, meaning you will wait an eternity to get your food.  The one consistent thing about this place is bad service all the time they never disappoint in this area."
43,"This McDonalds would not have any stars if it wasnt for the actual food tasting pretty good  and looking presentable, as compared to some fast food places that throw a burger together.  
I placed an order through the mobile order app, and 1 order was for a buttermilk crispy sandwich which went smoothly and the 2nd order was for an Oreo frappe and fries Just like any other time that I would do a mobile order I approach the drive-through and simply told the employee that I had ordered a mobile order and I would simply give a reference number and my order would be complete. This time, I pulled up to the window and had to repeat several times my order my order number and so on and so forth after about three times the lady just stop talking she didn't respond after several attempts to get her attentionSo I pull up to the next window and the gentleman was very polite and he did say that he wasn't quite sure about the mobile order and that I should come inside so I decide to do so. Once I came inside not only was the woman who I spoke with extremely rude at that point as well I also came to find she was a manager. I was approached with ""you got the crispy chicken right?"" And threw the bag down I told her yes I was but I had also ordered another item the Oreo frappe and french fries and it was her comment that was my shocking and she says well I didn't see that on my screen. So I was not going to receive that Oreo frappe or french fries X even after showing this manager my receipt on my mobile app for payment. The manager that time said it was not her problem was I had paid for it or not it was not her screen so it's not heProblem I told her it indeed was her problem and in fact does not mind considering she was the manager there now mom story short they were extremely extremely unprofessional they had the least amount of class I've seen in a very long time and just very very rude 
And that's all without mentioning I didn't recieve my fries I paid for or the credit fowards buy 5 McCafé/ 1 free"
44,Went through drive thru twice for 3 soft taco supremes and 1 burrito supremes only to have the orders wrong a rude manager and really cold tacos and all got said well its cold because they sat it at the window while someone cooked the burrito supreme!!! I work fast food and I know this is not how you do a customer!!!
45,"Shop around and find a different mover.  The movers were nice people.  I am not sure how these folks stay in business.  Unsuccessful in almost every regard.

Find someone else."
46,"Before eating at Pizza Hut, you should answer the following question:

""Do I hate myself?"" 

If you answered ""yes,"" you should definitely visit this establishment. ""Why?,"" you ask? Well, because you'll be greeted by a hostess who has to wipe down the table with a dirty rag right in front of you. Then, they'll tell you your drinks will ""take a while"" because they are out of clean cups. Once your food arrives, you won't be given silverware, plates, or half of what you actually ordered. And keep in mind, all of this occurred while an uncensored Rated R movie played on the tv. That's what this Pizza Hut has in store for you.

Or maybe you'll have a better experience. But probably not."
47,"I'm not proud of the fact I hit the occasional drive thru. It's just too darn quick and easy. The next time I'm tempted to stop in, I'll try to remember the wave of nausea and gastric distress my wife and I both experienced shortly after eating a burger from this McDonald's."
48,"Never call these folks, can't get anything right, no specials. Plenty of other options to call,jets,papa John's, dominoes, sir pizza. This place is horrible"
49,"I feel sick to my stomach just giving this Rallys one star. We visited on August 11, 2015. We went with family and ordered separately. They gave us all our food in 1 bag. We had 6 peoples good thrown in one bag. I got my coke, which tasted like diet so I opened the lid and there was a black hair. The man that took our order had a afro and no hair net on the other had dreads and also no hair net. I took my soda and told them I wanted a bottle water. My bf newphew had hair in his food as well. They messed our whole order up. The entire trip was discussting. I will never eat there or  reccommed anyone to ever eat there."
50,The dirtiest dining room ever worst customer service ever this place is a complete shithole i will never return
51,"Would give this place negative stars if possible... just wanted a coffee... sat in the drive thru for over 30 minutes.... they are either severely understaffed or do not understand the workflow... I've worked at a fast food chain before and never have seen this before. There was only 2 cars in front of me. It's bad because I sat here writing this review as I am waiting for the coffee. Highly depressing and it sucks since it's a multi billion dollar chain, it won't get changed..."
52,"How much intelligence does it take? I ordered 3 soft taco supremes for my girlfriend with no lettuce using the Taco Bell app. I double checked that I requested no lettuce. Yes, I probably should have checked the order before driving the 6 miles home, but I didn't think they'd get the order wrong AGAIN. And these people want $15 an hour?"
53,Didn't want to leave 1 star Too freakin slow in the drive thru.... 35 minute wait for $10 worth of food.
54,I went there on a Thursday night and they ran out of beef! How do you run out of beef at a Taco Bell! So I asked if I could get a discount on the chicken tacos because they were out of beef and they said no. They weren't even offering coupons. The people at the drive thru were fighting with each other as I got my order. If my kids didn't really want tacos I would have left. I am not going back to that Taco Bell ever again. I plan on calling corporate.
55,If i could give zero stars i would! This place sucks. I know you cant expect too much intelligence from a fast food restaurant but a little care for the customer would be nice. I will not ever go back!
56,"Another Taco Bell didn't have beef (WHAT!?!) so we tried this one, and they said they couldn't help b/c they didn't have enough staff to run the Taco Bell!!!  Is Taco Bell going out of business.  Horrible, horrible.  Never going back again.  Broke my kids hearts...they just wanted a cheese roll up...OMG.  Taco Bell, try caring about your customers.  Freaking ridiculous."
57,"I had been visiting this location quite a few times in my six months living in the area now, and they've officially lost a customer. Sadly the reviews I'm seeing is greatly comparable but this will be the first about the employees completely unacceptable behavior.

I pull up to the drive thru, and once the girl answers, I say ""I'll have a number 7 please"". Her reply was ""which number seven"". I said ""uhh the quesadilla?"" Then she proceeded to mouth of that I should have ""common sense that there are two restaurants here and when you're ordering there are more than one..."" I replied "" well that was a little rude, but I'd like the one with the quesadilla"". She went on and on again so I drove off, parked my car and went inside to talk to a manager. This attempt I talked to both a shift lead and the general manager and explained her behavior was quite rude, ordered my food, PAID FOR MY FOOD, and attempted to leave. But this is not the end of it.

The girl and a couple other employees were now picking up the parking lot and taking trash out, as I was pulling out of the parking lot one of them yelled something out as I was passing by. So I turned around, went back inside and THIS TIME I talked to the DISTRICT MANAGER! Explained the whole thing again and politely told him that I had in fact been an employee to this company before, and this behavior was absolutely unacceptable and would be subject to more severe consequences. But all in all, I did learn one thing about working in a place like that. Yes, you're paid minimum wage and the job sucks, but how you carry yourself to be a professional will go a long way. What they didn't know is that I, myself, being that girl at the window at Taco Bell years ago blessed me with another job opportunity that later brought me to the success I have today. 

I will probably never visit this location again, and I don't think I've ever been this pissed off about ordering tacos! I'll just sit here in the target parking lot, eat my food and hope this was handled accordingly."
58,"Went to this location few Saturdays ago. Ordered a $5.00 pizza and Crazy Bread. Was there almost 30 minutes. It seems this location caters more to call ins than walk ins. Perhaps they could divide their time between the two customers groups rather than have a walk in customer wait for so long while waiting on the people coming in for pick-ups. 
Haven't been here in a long time and thought I would give it a try again. Disappointed and most probably will not be back."
59,I'm changing my 5 star rating to a one because I can't make a negative number.. they use to be my go to as someone that's worked downtown at bars for many years.. tonight I got physically threatened just because I tried to show up to make an order rather than use GrubHub.. last time I used GH my food was about an hour late.. I went to make a pick up order and was greeted with a man locking the door and telling me he was going to beat my a** if I didn't leave. I called the cops and GH to let them know. This is the WORST thing to happen to Nashville since fanfair.
60,"Don't know how a fast food restaurant can get worse over time and still stay open. I kept hearing the commercials for the new improved chicken nuggets for really cheap. Should have known i was going to leave unhappy. First they were super slow to answer the drive through order. Then to tell me they were out of BBQ sauce, i was slightly annoyed but ok and asked for Mustard, Then i asked for Diet Coke and they were either out or having issues so i asked for bottled water. When i pulled up everyone ignored me for at least 5 min, then when they did open the window just a hand stuck out, not even acknowledging me. I gave them my Card and was rung up. The whole time sitting there i noticed a bag on the counter, i had a feeling it was mine and i was right. My order sat there for nearly 8 min before handed to me. Explains why it wasn't warm. Then they gave me ketchup instead of mustard and yup No water. I was too pissed off to deal with them, so i got my order and left. It was my fault for trying them out again, thinking they had changed. Nope i now know i will NEVER go back to this location again, and most likely all Burger Kings."
61,I would give zero stars because this place DOES NOT EXIST!!!!! It is a scam so beware everyone. Do not order anything.
62,"I will try to keep this one as gentle as possible.

This place sucks.

This location is probably the most inconsistent one out there. Nothing is ever made on a good standard level that I know McDonald's can deliver. 

Sometimes you get a sweet tea, it's great. Sometimes, it's bland. Sometimes, it's like drinking sugar. This goes for everything else on the menu. It's like gambling to go here.

Also, they do not like to give you your change (1 - 4 cents) back. I thought it was standard? I only had this problem on drive-thru though.

It is not ""24/7 drive-thru"" either. I went by around 4 in the morning, and was told they were closed. I guess they make their own rules! Oh, I love the Girard and Broad intersection."
63,"Literally just got my food handed to me sideways....ordered some nachos and had to eat them off of the lid.

Consistency is key, I guess."
64,Worst place ever! My Cinco De Mayo was ruined coming here. Service -1 Cleanliness-1 employees-1 misc-1 WTF Taco Bell pull your head out
65,"Terrible customer service and quality!!! Should've read the reviews.

I ordered through grub hub at the top of the hour, get a phone call 40 minutes afterwards from the driver who said he'd be there in 30 minutes. So I get off the phone and understandably think ""ok so an hour and 10 minutes for my delivery is a little long, but at least they have me a heads up."" An hour goes by and he still hasn't arrived. I then look at the reviews online and they are not good at all. So I call back and he says he's in he wrong building in my complex. So at this point I've waited an hour and 45 minutes just to find out this guys at the wrong place, and I had to call to find out. He shows up (finally) and I notice that my drinks are wrong and warm. After he rudely tries to make excuses he leaves cursing me. I open the boxes and the food looks awful and is cold. Tried to call back the restaurant and the driver to say I didn't want the order to no response. Had to call grub hub to get my refund and apparently the restaurant was rude to them as well. 

If I could give no stars I would. Waited almost two hours for the wrong drink which was warm, and cold pizza with the toppings dried out. Topping that with a rude driver and nonexistent customer service. These guys should just go out of business. Don't order here!"
66,"Just stopped in for a bathroom break and to get a drink and a large fri 
Very rude service my husband and I stood there for 3 mins while the 2 ladies had there back to us and was talking . As I said can I place a order in a nice voice I was ignored so I said it again and then she turned around and was like yes!!!!!! And was pissed because I interpreted her . 
Rude and the fires are old"
67,"We ordered from this restaurant Fri night 
It was by far the worst experience I have ever had with a restaurant. I recieved the order confirmation stating my order would be delivered in approximately 75 minutes at 7:45pm. That would make the delivery around 9pm. We didn't end up recieving our order until 10:10pm. When I called at 9:33pm I was offered no appology, but was told that our delivery was on the way and the driver should arrive in just a few minutes. After calling again at 10pm I again got no appology or even explaination, just a we're busy and an annoyed tone. When we finally recieved the pizza at 10:10pm it was very cold. We tried to eat a slice anyway because we were starving and it was terrible. We had ordered a meatball pizza and another pizza with sausage. The meat was very low quality and tasted like what I imagine my dogs treats would taste like. We had to throw it all away. On top of that when we requested a refund from the restaurant they refused. The only positive thing that came from this whole experience is the customer service we recieved from the app we used for the order, Slice. They quickly responded to our complaint and refunded our payment directly, since the restaurant refused. I highly recommend using the Slice app! I cannot recommend enough that you not do business with Lombardi's."
68,"Fucking horrible service, I ordered a milkshake and did not ever receive it and when we asked for a recipt the restraint strictly said no"
69,This is the absolute worst taco bell I have been to. I have been here multiple times hoping that one day it will get better but that has never happened. The convenience of being close to home is completely lost after you deal with how bad this place is. Avoid at all cost!
70,Incredibly slow. Our food was ready but employees just standing around and didn't collect the money for about 5 minutes of standing around. Ordered regular fries but got the size of a child's meal. Hamburger had wrong toppings and was not warm. Not sure what is going on here. Needs new management or something. Not going back.
71,This is possibly the worst I've ever been treated by a restaurant. Was hung up on and screamed at so loud my husband could hear him across the room. Even the staff at Grubhub were apparently treated the same way when they tried to intervene on my behalf. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!
72,"Waited 35 minutes for a dubble cheese burger..... it was around 3:30 pm, no line in the drive threw, a few cars in the parking lot, yet they still seemed to mess up a single, double cheese burger order... then I had to wait an additional 30 minutes for them to correct that single burger order.. wtf"
73,"Absolutely worst moving company ever, hands down. They took a ridiculously long time to complete the move, due to the fact that their workers are poorly trained and grossly underpaid. It ended up costing more than even the highest priced company would have. They damaged 3 pieces of furniture and blew me off when it came time to do the repairs. Do not hire this company. They mistreat their workers and their clients."
74,"They were out of beans.  A ""Mexican"" place was out of beans on a Saturday night around 10 p.m.  It was a nice night and I had my windows down. I could hear people complaining at the drive thru as it seemed like everyone in line had a bean-centric order.  All the poor window girl could do was apologize.  Back in the stone ages when I worked in fast food, if we ran out of an ingredient (which was rare), we went to another location to get more.  They couldn't do that?  Hopefully all these one-star reviews will catch the owner's attention. Love me some Taco Bell, but I avoid this location.  Oh, and nothing more charming that seeing employees sitting on the front stoop smoking during their break."
75,"This is probably the WORST Taco Bell I have ever been to. I have come here countless times and not a single time did I receive even subpar service. 
Whether the complaint be receiving the wrong food, being yelled at by employees, walking into a filthy restaurant, not having a large portion of their menu available, employees yelling at each other, managers yelling at employees, this Taco Bell/ KFC has it! So if you're looking for a terrible meal (assuming they have the food they advertise on their menu) with a nice side of trash on the floor, this is the place for you. 

Assuming you are NOT interested in being demeaned by minimum wage employees doing a sub sub par job, I'd suggest going to ANY other Taco Bell in the United States."
76,"Thank god I have a receipt to tell corporate how horrible this place was. I should've read the reviews before coming here. I know it's a fast food joint, but this is the worst! I witnessed them making food without gloves on! Disgusting! I even told the cashier to tell them to put gloves on, but he walked right past them. It took over 20 minutes to get my food and about ten minutes to get my order taken! Ridiculous! I warned a few customers too about them wearing no gloves and they walked out. The cashier looked high out of his mind and the rest of the staff was rude. I even saw one girl touch the bottom of her shoe and continue making food. Gross!"
77,Flies all over and even though it wasn't crowded it took 10 minutes for someone to come to the register to help me and waited an additional  30+ minutes for my food and all I ordered was a sausage mcmuffin meal. And after all that I had to get out of my car and go back in because they forgot the hashbrown.
78,"New name for a long-time place that never seems to succeed.  No wonder - wait staff very scattered, kitchen out of food, wait staff nice but completely clueless.  Food OK, but really slow service, told that the ""chef is cranky and mean.""  No thanks."
79,"Today we arrived at the drive-thru at 11am and sat for quite awhile. Not sure if they were having computer issues, we pulled forward to the window. An employee informed us that at that time they were technically open but not taking orders yet since they were counting their register drawers. At 11:20am they were still turning customers away, which is pretty crazy since they are supposed to open at 10:30am. 
Needless to say, Wendy's next door was getting quite a bit of business."
80,"Walked in for breakfast wanted takeout. Was told sorry ""we don't do takeout"", what??? How can a restaurant not offer takeout? All i seen was 2 people eating from an uncovered buffet.
I wont be be back."
81,Do NOT go here.... I wish I'd read the yelp before going in. Several employees ganged around up front shooting the bull... I ordered fish and chicken with an extra pc. of fish...they didn't include it!!! I'm glad now that they didnt... it was cooked to a crisp.. see pic. Chicken pcs. the same way!!! I won't be coming back to this one!!! Two young men that I dealt with though were very polite.
82,"We are here now. Very dirty! The drink bar is filthy and has not been cleaned in hours. All tables dirty, got a gift card for this place. Walk out of the WhitE House location first for same reason. This restaurant is going down hill. Keep driving don't stop here,"
83,"Terrible. Staff is terrible and has screwed up my orders on multiple occasions.  The late night crew smoking right next to the pick up window. The terribly rude staff that gives me at least an average of one thing wrong per order, and the completely unapologetic reaponse when you complain. I will be conplaining to every outlet i can. Even the crappy downtown mcdonalds are better. I will be contacting someone higher up, and if i do not hear back i will keep going till someone does something."
84,Long wait. Pleasant front counter staff. I had wait longer than expected. The manager was unusually loud. Screaming to the top of her lungs requesting things from staff.
85,"Poor service, limited delivery area and the drive through is busted. Showed up on a Saturday evening to get a carry out order and went through the drive through only to learn that it was closed when we pulled up to the window. So, we parked and tried to go inside. The door closest to the drive through was locked. I wondered if they were even open because i couldn't see a soul eating in the dining room. I happened to see someone standing at the carryout counter, so we walked around to the other side. There were several people waiting to get their carry out orders since the drive through was busted. The kid working the counter looked like he hadn't bathed in about a week. We stood in line for about 5 minutes to get our order. Once it was our turn, the kid working the register made a snide comment about the shirt and hat I was wearing. (My college alma mater). I informed him that I went to school there and he then went on to insult me even further. Way to treat your customers with respect! No wonder the dining room was empty."
86,Never got my hot wings called back they said they would do a redelivery. Still to this day I have never got my wings... Will never ever order anything from here
87,Took over an hour. Wrong items in order came and wings were tiny and gray. Most unappetizing thing i ever saw
88,Worst management and employees ever. The place is a big trash can and nobody cares at all to clean or do their jobs. If I owned this place I would fire everyone here. First time here and it will be my last. This place sucks! This is the  worst fast food place in history!
89,"The absolute worst location you can goto. It's a tacobell/kfc and they are always under staffed or have no idea what is going on. The workers are always so rude. One day I asked the manager if they keep anything stocked and he said ""probably not"" seriously?! And tonight was going to go after work and they got rude with me in the drive thru and said they just closed. Hours say they close at 11pm. So I called a few mins after and a guy picked up and said they were going to close in 5mins...... who runs this location it needs to be closed! Horrible horrible horrible service and can't believe how much attitude they all have. This place deserves 0 stars!!!!"
90,"One of the worst places I've been to. Me and my boyfriend decided to get a bundle box, and when the cashier who attended us called us over, who might I add had no skills at all in talking to any customer except their hood rat friends, I tried to ask him what the box was called (since we never actually knew the name) and he just kept saying "" I don't know"". And then he proceeded to just say that he was joking and stuff and told us the name so we ordered. We noticed it didn't come with drinks so we just stood back in line and he was literally behind that drinks on his phone. It took his Manager or whoever to let him know that we were there. He came over and I told him I wanted a Sweet Tea and he rudely asked me if that was all. Not even gonna lie, this man seemed high and completely detached from what he was doing. But anyway we sat down because we kinda assumed it would take a minute since we ordered the box. About 15 minutes went by and we still didn't get our food, but I noticed a bundle box behind the counter but wasn't sure if it was ours. 5 more minutes go by,so I decide to go up to the counter so they could see I was waiting. The cashier that attended us asked if I was waiting for something and I told him our bundle box, he picked up the bundle box that was sitting there for the longest time and gave it to us. As I grabbed the food I said ""So it's just been sitting there the whole time"" and walked away and as I was walking away some girl is gonna say that it's not her fault because she called out the number and no one came. Usually the workers yell out the number, and neither me or my boyfriend heard her say anything at all. And the food wasn't good at all. It was just nasty and the fries were almost stale. It was just really disgusting and the place smelled bad too. They need to throw the whole restaurant away."
91,"This is the worst McDonald's on the face of the earth. Period. I strongly wish they get their franchise pulled it's an absolute joke. Expect to wait 20 minutes at least. Expect a very rude, not trained staff, THEY DONT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. Has your staff ever been to a McDonald's before? I am a huge advocate for McDonald's and visit frequently but this one is so absolutely pitiful it makes me want to go across the street to checkers(eww)."
92,"I would give a zero if possible, if only I looked at the reviews first! To be completely honest, they movers were fast, didn't waste time, and punctual. I thought all was well until I turned on my tv and the display didn't work. Initial contact with customer service was great, send pictures model etc and we will file a claim, pretty standard- until communication stopped! No updates, no returned calls or emails, and most importantly no resolution!! I waited well over a month trying to understand that claims do take time but no communication? That doesn't work for me, customer service is all about CUSTOMER SERVICE. I would never recommend this company which is unfortunate because client satisfaction is not a priority for them."
93,We always avoid this location because they just can't get it together. Once we waited at least 5 minutes at the drive thru just for them to tell us their drive thru is closed due to short staffed. Any other time we still have to wait at least 5 minutes to get to the order speaker then it's at least 2 minutes til someone ask what you'd like to order. By then the kids are anxious and starving so we leave and go to the Wendy's down the street
94,Just went in and ordered 10 cherseburgers. Manager on duty had a very nasty attitude. The drive thru was already backed up so i went inside thinking it may have been faster....NOT! I still waited patiently and then placed my order...mgr said to coworkers that my order was going to back them up further. I shouldnt be made to feel like its my fault you cant run your line more efficiently because of what I ordered. My only complaint is with the manager that was working on 8/21/16 @ 12:15pm. Very rude. Other employees were very polite and accommodating.
95,First of all they couldnt deliver one block to my hotel. The girl answering the phone could not spell Plaza. Then they sent the wrong pasta. When I finally got the pasta it was awful. Taste was nasty. Bread sticks were old and hard. I dont understand why Puzza Hut doesn't fix this! Go to the grocery store and nuke some Swanson. Buy a loaf of bread. It'll save you money plus it'll taste better. The benefit is that you wont have to give some moron a spelling lesson.
96,"Bleech! Sadly this location is very skimpy with ingredients.  Often food items are stale and often messy with slatherings of other food items mixed in.  There has been one young lady at Drive-Thru who was friendly and professional, but rest of staff has regularly been rude, slow, careless, and unprofessional.  How can a national chain allow for such sub-par service.  Go to the Taco Bell on W 86th by Traders Point or by the Pyramids - much better quality."
97,"If I could give this McDonald's a negative star, I would give it -5. WORST McDonalds EVER by the long. Horrible service, long wait, just horrible..."
98,"Definitely the worst McDonald's I've been yet.

Growing up, I loved McDonald's even McDonald's himself had always looked creepy to me. (I've always been a fan of the Hamburglar but never mind that) I adored their food and remember how big and plump the Big Mac seemed and not this mushed together thing that we've come to known. Up until recently that I realized how bad fast food actually is and I've swore off it for years. That is until now that my job has brought me to an area of culinary desert, we got nothing but fast food, fried chicken and a deli around the 4 blocks area. It's a dead zone.

So I've retreated to fast food, a man's got to eat. Especially when the man is forgetful when he gets home and too lazy sometimes to plan his own lunch ahead.

I've been to this McDonald's 3 times for breakfast and lunch alike. While in surface, everything taste the same. This McDonald's is the most ghettlest of them all. Their cashiers have the nastiest attitude even I try to use thank you and please to force some customer service out of them.

The juice is half filled. When there is no ice in the ice machine, they just stand there and say they will refill it soon but they don't. They give you one napkin for your whole meal and there's no additional napkins to be found. They don't give you any ketchup or peanut or spoons for your sundae. They give you 1/3 of the normal amount of chocolate sauce for your sundae. Just a little on top like a suggestion that it is a chocolate sundae. The ice cream is also half-full (half-empty if you're a pessimist) and half-melted (half-solid if you're an optimist). It's not like I know them so I wonder why they act like I'm the asshole who's bothering them by making them go get my food. No smile and full of 'tude. Is there no quality control?

Well, it'll just make me want to bring my lunch more and hopefully keep me from being supersized"
99,I came in one evening and it the workers so long to come talk to me. And I didn't order much but it took 20 mins to get my food. On top of that the workers are ghetto as hell. I'll come back only because I love taco bell but once I find a different one I'm done.
100,"In desperation, stopped by there to get hot wings. Spent $12 and only ate 3, they were not seasoned, not hot and a waste of money. Tried calling to complain and return them, no answer. I figured it would be better to take the loss than to risk whatever I would get as a replacement. Never again!"
101,"I have been here a few times and only to see Anthony Gomes perform.  Tonight I visited again and brought some new people.  Nothing has changed as far as food and service.   Mediocre food; very poor service.  The service did improve when a nice young lady took over from the young man.  I asked three times for an item that was supposed to come with the meal.  Those same three times I asked for a straw.  There were maybe 25 people in the place and seven were at my table.  The staff was way more interested in table arrangements and reserving spaces.  I didn't understand that because the tables and chairs are quickly moved when Anthony begins.  Thank goodness they can get someone like Anthony in there occasionally.  I would never go back if it wasn't for him.  I was shocked when my bill was 100% correct.  Very little was correct tonight....except the blues.  This place is totally missing the mark.  Improve the menu, train your staff, be attentive to your customer's needs and perhaps this could be a good place to go in Apollo Beach."
102,3/3 visits and out of chicken?? How is this possible when all they do is chicken. I have given KFC so many tries but I'm always disappointed. Makes me sad because I used to love it
103,Worst McDonald's ever. So dirty and the customer service is like shit. Don't go!! Flies all over the place and the foods are bad
104,"I hate this location no one is nice and everyone is rushed. I was at the drive threw and they got mad cause I asked them to wait than when I was ready they yelled at me ""Yeah what ya want"" so I started to order and the girl was so rude I asked for blue poweraid ""we ain't got blue"" I said ""ok the fruit punch"" ""you want grape"" well I ordered and was told to pull forward when I got to the window the lady said 13.35 I gave her 13.50 never got my change or a receipt. I was thrown a bag and she walked away I waited and asked if that was everything and she just looked at me... So as I pull off my husband tells me there is only 2 half full cups of tator tots there is 4 of us in the car so I'm missing 2 of those and I ordered French toast sticks for my daughter and I didn't get any syrup... Well this will be the last time I go there and I will be calling corporate later to see about how I get change back. We had to go to McDonald's to get my kids more hash browns cause that wasn't enough."
105,"Avoid this location.

Every experience here has been bad. From the slow drive thru (taking roughly 8-10 minutes per car in front of you) to not taking credit card payments, not having enough staff to open the drive thru or main lobby and my personal favorite ""no one here is trained to make that"".  Please do yourself a favor and go anywhere else. The only reason they get a 1 star rating is because 0 star rating as unavailable. 

Frankly, this location is poorly managed and it shows."
106,"We decided to go to this place because they had a deal on Living Social.  We got there and told the waitress we wanted to sit outside and that there were four of us.  We ended up having to get our own table and chairs put together and didn't have silverware.  The food at the buffet was not covered and therefore everything was cold.  Our waitress never came by to see how we were doing and we had to go inside and ask someone else if we could get a glass of water.  To finish everything off we were told they decided not to accept the Living Social coupons anymore because they were having trouble getting reimbursed.  Poor food, poor service."
107,"Terrible ordering experience. They have a newish $5 Menu, which i ordered from. I was literally HOLDING the stand up from the counter for the $5 Menu and the girl rang my items up as regular price, in addition to asking me no less than 3 times to repeat my flavor choices. She claimed she did not know that i was ordering from the $5 Menu and had to get a manager to correct. The manager came and corrected, she asked the original girl what flavors i picked, and the girl again asked me what i wanted. On top of that, i ordered 2 orders of wings and asked for ranch as she was running my card and she stopped in her tracks. Apparently they now don't even include a single ranch for orders of wings and she suggested i go somewhere else to get ranch. 

Id suggest you go to the one 5 minutes away on Nissan Dr. In my (limited) experience they are much friendlier and seem to know what they are doing, in stark contrast to the employees at this location."
108,"Waited 40 min in drive thru, was stuck as there was no way to pull out.  Order was wrong, rice in cantina bowl was not fully cooked and crunchy.   Terrible service from employees who don't care.  Been back since hoping for a beter experience, not any better :("
109,"My wife and I really enjoy Taco Bell as a quick, tasty, cheap treat. Whenever we moved to Alton less than a mile away from this location, we were pretty excited. However, every time we've visited, the food has been terrible. Wrong orders, unwrapped food, long waits--even in the drive thru when no one else was there! This place should not be able to call itself a Taco Bell."
110,"Horrible place! Ordered from here Christmas night as they were one of the only places open. First said they don't take credit cards, then when we were ready to cancel, all of a sudden they take credit cards!

Food was mediocre at best, but worst than that, a week later my credit card number had been stolen and was being used in Houston, TX. 

I Travel to Nashville a lot! I will go hungry before I order from here again!"
111,"AWFUL!!!! I only gave one star because Yelp does not have negative star options. If it did, I would not be so generous to even give one star. I paid $10.68 for 10 tiny, dry, chicken wings; they hardly had any chicken on them. I also purchased a ""Large"" pizza, that was really a medium. I hoped that the pizza itself would make up for it's clearly erroneous size, but that was a loser, too. I made the mistake of not reading the reviews before ordering. Big mistake. The reviews are all accurate as to how awful this place is. Stay away."
112,"I'm rating this on the order I never received. I ordered a calzone from Lombardi's last night and the expected delivery time of 55 minutes changed to 2 hours. Okay I get it, it was game night. But then after not receiving my order after 3 hours of waiting I had to fight with Grubhub to get Lombardi's to give me my money back. Judging by the lack of stars Lombardi's has, it looks like they aren't going to stay open long."
113,"I am typically a fan of Subway, but this location is awful. They had no iced tea and no apples so instead of the kids meal ($5), we paid for a 6"" ham & cheese sandwich ($4) plus chips ($1) and powerade ($2) for our daughter. She asked if she could get the Big Hero 6 bag to go with her meal. The response was no because she didn't order a kids meal, but we could pay $2 extra if she really wanted one. Seriously!? This location will not get my business again."
114,Was sat down and then waited for twenty minutes of being completely ignored before finally giving up and leaving. Judging by the disgusting food at the buffet not eating here was probably the right idea anyway.
115,"If I could give them ZERO stars, I would. Their lack of customer service was astonishing...initially I was concerned that my order wasn't processed correctly because the delivery was 30 minutes past due. 

What was ordered? I wanted to try a chicken and bacon panini...got some awful looking hoagie with mystery meat. Also ordered 10 piece mild buffalo wing, what arrived was a boneless BBQ nuggets. 

Business refused to refund or replace order upon notification, the only response was ""they prepared the correct food"". 

Where did Ray's lunchbox wrapping paper come from?!"
116,"Worst fast food experience of my life. Rude. Delayed. Disorganized. Of the myriad of things that went wrong during my dine in visit to this location, the blatant rudeness and disregard for basic customer service was by far the most appalling. DO NOT EAT AT THIS LOCATION."
117,"Used to be one of my favorite spots on my take out rotation until today. 

First I'll state the obvious: no business is perfect and everybody has off days but in my books its 3 strikes and you're out... like this place. 

No pleasure in doing this today but, i ordered a cheesesteak with extra meat and fries before and it was great. Ordered today and it was atrocious... extra meat? I got maybe half of a regular order and the fries were crushed upon delivery. Charged me approx $19, yes $19, for some flimsy cheesesteak and crushed fries... didn't even send ketchup packets. 

Long story short the food quality and portions are never consistent. You could order something once and love it but the next time ask yourself ""what is this?""."
118,"This McDonald's is a literal nightmare. I've witnessed drive thru window fights. Literally, two people inside the window fighting the employees as they agitated. No one does anything here besides stand around. I got bitched at one day because some girl working the window handed me my drink and said have a good night and slammed it shut. Well, I ordered a meal, not a drink. When I beeped to clarify if she got my food order I was treated like some kind of imbecile because she could see my order ""on the screen in here!"" She ""can't miss it!!""

Avoid at all costs. If this was the only McDonald's left on this great planet, I'd still eat white dog shit before dealing with these Neanderthals."
119,"Tried this place again and just have to wonder at all the glowing, positive reviews out there.  While the service was attentive (in an empty restaurant), the order came out wrong, my side salad was over-dressed with limp lettuce and just terrible.  My order was supposed to come over rice, but it came with an (unexplained) side of fries and no offer of catsup or other condiments - I couldn't find the attentive waiter after he dropped our food and the meal was almost over before I could get catsup.  Beef tasted off, didn't eat it.  Seriously uninspired food.  And I don't trust steam table buffet food that's left sitting out uncovered when you could shoot a cannon in the place and not hit anyone.   Sorry, Oasis on the Boulevard, but you're not my idea of food salvation in a desert."
120,This location always takes a very long time to get food out. The inside is not very clean and you can always hear the workers fighting and cussing. Not only does it take a long time they never get orders right.
121,"Reviewing a McDonald's....yes, it's silly, but the public needs to be warned to never visit this one.

2 stars: I can't knock this place for being unhealthy. When you intentionally visit a McDonald's establishment, you go knowing full well the consequences. So 2 stars for the food and impending heartburn. 

3 stars: The French Fries. Not going to lie. I would eat them right now if presented with those delicious golden bitches.

0 Stars: The unbelievably terrible service. Now I know I'm not going to receive a 5-star experience, but come on. One time my bf ordered a double cheeseburger and received it sans burger patties (only buns, lettuce, onions, ketchup), another time we ordered TWO STRAWBERRY milkshakes and received THREE VANILLA milkshakes. How is that even possible? 0 stars for incompetency. Don't even THINK about specializing your order.

Somehow it also takes them forever and a half to get your order to you. So not only is it incorrect, but it is also delivered to your car just seconds before you decide to eat your shoes.

0 stars: For only having meals after 10 o'clock.

Grand Total of 1 star...and that's a generous gift."
122,Simply horrible service. I visited this restaurant between 8 and 8:30 pm. My burger was cold and the onion rings was also. I specifically asked that my food be hot. At first I ask the rude cashier to replace my onion ring. She took them back and brought me the same ones but she had re dropped them ughh. The manager was also rude. Don't visit this place it's simply horrible
123,this resturant sucks i got a cheesy potato burrito with extra potatoes and there were VERY few potatoes and they were all HARD AND BURNT!
124,"About two or three nights ago I pulled up to the drive through and sat for several minutes waiting for someone to take my order. I could see an employee standing by the window not paying attention. She glanced over a couple of time but did nothing. Angry, I decided to go inside and speak with a manager.  While waiting in line I saw the same employee drop cups on the floor and pur them back twice! I spoke with the manager and voiced my complaints but ahe didn't seem very shocked or concerned that no one was running the drive through. I'm not sure why I go this tacobell. I only ever have problems and they are slow. I do want to apologize to the lady running the front counter, you got the brunt on my wife's wrath while your incompetent manager and fellow employee bumbled around and you didn't really deserve that. You were just doing your job and you were nice. Again I apologize."
125,I'm scared to even look at the rest of my food if this is what my cheesy gordita crunch looks like. Was it that hard to melt cheese? You obviously weren't too busy because the building is being remodeled so there's nobody in the interior waiting on you and there was only one car in front of me in the drive-through
126,Worst Taco Bell ever. Yet my idiot self keeps coming back to it thinking they will get better. Indy needs a new one. Badly. Horrible experience every time I come. Soggy tacos EVERY.TIME. And that's just the beginning.
127,This facility is not worth a single star. Who puts $25 worth of food in one little bag. And didn't even put all the food in the bag. Cold half full tacos is what u will get stay away from this location.
128,"Wish I could give ZERO stars. I was there 2/2/19 around 10:30 pm. It was not busy at all. Service was slow and the customer service was atrocious. To top it alll off I got a cheeseburger.. simplest thing, and they decided to add a ton of mayo.. why?? I didn't ask for that? So I turn around drive back and they are rude to me when I ask for a new one. I am like beside myself.  I love McDonald's and this location has just did me so poorly that I will never be going back. Learn how to hire better staff McDonald's. Smh."
129,"This place is ridiculous. We ordered out food at 8:20. Its now 9:15. When we got to the window they never even started on our food. Cars behind us was yelling at us like it's out fault. All we ordered was there big Macs and two Apple pie. When we got to the window they said they had no more apple pie. How do you charge someone something and then tell them they don't have it.

They are either very under employed or they are completely disorganized but definitemy will never come back here again."
130,"This is by far THE most unprofessional McDonald's I have ever been to. The wait is incredibly long, the order is never right, and the worst part is most of the staff has an awful attitude like you are bothering them...unacceptable.The franchise owner really needs to revamp this place. I would be embarrassed to own this McDonald's. The attitude of the employees start from the top and when the managers are openly expressing their attitude toward customers, that's where I draw the line. The customer is never right at this location. What a shame."
131,This place is very unorganized and borderline unsanitary. No matter the temperature there are always flies buzzing around. Every few months I decide to give them the benefit of the doubt and each time I decide to eat elsewhere. Take a 5 minute drive to Oxford Circle instead
132,"Sat in the drive through for 35 minutes waiting for my food, the order came out in correct, and waited an additional 25 minutes for the correct order. Not to mention the inside was completely empty.... not even a crazy busy night. Beyond frustrated"
133,Filthy filthy filthy. I just can't get past the messy dining room. I would leave zero stars if possible.  Even the parking lot is filthy. Yuck.
134,"One thing is certain, McDonalds employees are the absolute bottom of the barrel, they sneer, don't look at you while they mumble. Everyone is pissed and they hate the customers. The food is prepared to a minimum of satisfaction. Pay me 100k a year and I promise the reviews will be 5 stars everyday. How can McDonalds be so consistently horrible?"
135,"Swung by on December 15th to pickup a quick bite and treat, purchased (2) spicy chicken as well as (2) oreo stackers - not really checking order for accuracy. When arriving home my wife had noticed the both oreo stackers were Chocolate versus Vanilla & Chocolate swirl. Not a big deal as we live right around the corner, so I had my wife go back to request a new stacker and a refund on the other (as she had to go to work, and would not have time to come back home after already leaving). Regretfully, it was a lot more complicating than you would think!! When explaining the situation to the young lady and requesting for another stacker, she assured my wife it was made right and that it was supposed to be all Chocolate. My wife replied we've purchased these many times, from this location, and have never had one all Chocolate as well as explaining the receipt even showed Vanilla. She assured my wife whoever made it the previously, must have done it wrong as you specifically have to ask for Vanilla. My wife said okay, however she still wanted at least a Vanilla one (at this point giving up on the refund of my stacker due to how complicating it was at this point). The young girl explained unfortunately she is not ""allowed"" to do so, and said would you like to speak with my General Manager? My wife said no, she just wanted a replacement. After several minutes of waiting (as the young girl closed the window after my wife's response), she came back and said is there something you're waiting for? My wife said yes, the replacement? She then said she'll have to go talk to her General Manager then to see if she can, and ended up coming back with the correct item. 

I hope management takes reviews seriously and considers retraining staff in how to make items they offer correctly, as well as how to handle situations like this (versus challenging the customer that they're wrong, then stating the GM doesn't ""allow"" them to make it the correct way as advertised)...especially considering this item is on YOUR menu showing Vanilla swirl not including your website which has the following description - Layers of hot fudge, creamy VANILLA & Chocolate swirl soft-serve and Oreo cookie crumbles (see picture attached). I am beyond dissatisfied from the customer service that was provided, and will second think coming back to one of my ""used to be"" regular spots for a quick bite."
136,"This is the third time I've walked into this location and there wasn't an employee to come great me, also the third time they haven't had any hot and ready pizzas available or cooking. Absolutely ridiculous I'll definitely be taking my money somewhere else."
137,"It took 2 1/2 hours to have our pizza delivered to us and it was ice cold when we got it. Not room temp, ""ice"" cold. Don't they have insulated bags for delivery of pizzas? Two and a half hours........the pizza was one of the worst pizzas I've ever tasted."
138,I just came in this kfc at 9pm and the doors were already locked then when I went to go thru the drive thru they shut the lights off on me!!!!!!!
139,Went to popeyes today and it will not last long with the terrible service they arw giving. Bad attitudes from management on down. No one has a since of urgency we waited 20 mins for cold chicken and they forgot 2 sides. Then when we went back to the counter to get what we paid for and fresh chickwn they gave us attitude. I will never go here again horrible.
140,"I got Mac and cheese from here the other day and oh my lord it was the NASTIEST Mac and cheese I've had in my entire life. And this is not an exaggeration whatsoever. I wouldn't feed it to a rabid raccoon. I'm sure a raccoon wouldn't even eat it, and they specialize in eating garbage. Just trying to put things in perspective. Never again. Ever. Returning to this KFC and I live less than a mile away...."
141,"Today I read the menu and placed an order. The girl at the drive thru said that's not what she sign meant. I graduated grad school with a 3.8, but cant understand how to read or comprehend a chicken menu? This location has dirty entrance doors, a girl on the drive through with minimal comprehension, can the food be trusted? Not taking any chances. I drove from East Nadhville to Clarksville Hwy instead."
142,"Since I have to rate it one star for the win...... first off, I contacted McDonald's and haven't heard back at all. This particular store has no identifying manager so I'll say it's self run by the employees and it needs a manager badly, the staff is rude, the food gave me a stomach bug for dayssss and I mean days!, hygiene needs to be a serious priority at this establishment."
143,"NO. Don't order delivery. I ordered at 6:45PM, Grub Hub said delivery would be between 8:40-8:50PM (what?!), they missed that window, then customer service confirmed the place was CLOSED. NEVER AGAIN."
144,Went there at 9:30 two days in a row and the drive thru attendant said they were close both times when the hours say they are open till 10.
145,"Worst place. No one cares or wants to help. Rude 
Wonder why??? Came for Temple game. No Temple students should ever go here"
146,"It appears that this KFC suffers from extremely poor management. In March we went on a 40 degree day and they had the inside temp no higher than 45 to 50. Three weeks ago there was a horrible stench pervading the restaurant, but today the employees decided to skip the subtle ways to drive people away and simply locked the doors early. We arrived to find locked doors at 9:15 when the sign on the door clearly stated the dining room closes at 10:00. 

If the employees bully management on these issues I can only imagine how filthy and unsanitary the cooking area is."
147,"Food is horrible and way overcooked, always getting orders wrong and the employees have no sense of urgency. Do not stop by if you are looking for a nice fresh meal before you hit the road."
148,Worst experience ever. I understand that it's  after new years but that no reason to show a terrible attitude to paying customer. Seamless told me the meal was accepted and in the process of being made. Never made it to my door. This place leave you irritated and even hungrier. Deserves to be shutdown
149,"Hate this place... void this place at all cost! This is not my first time being disappointed but of course I had to give them another try. I was in the drive-thru Sat.night 10/22/2017 there was along line there but of course the kid's and I just wanted McDonald's and waited. I arrived at the drive-thru  at 11:40pm at 11:57pm the woman took my order of:8 cheeseburgers, 2 med. fries, a small frie, two sm. cokes. Only to have her say, ""we don't got no cheeseburgers and we're about to close."" After all that wait time. My thought was I'm at McDonald's but I was just so mad. What a great disappointment!!!!! A BIG THANK-YOU TO COTTMAN AVE. MCDONALD'S WHO WERE MORE ACCOMMODATING WHERE I SHOULD HAVE WENT IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!!!"
150,"1 patty on a double cheeseburger...a susage mcmuffin instead of a sausage egg and cheese on a buiscuit...and oreo frappe instead of chocolate chip..no apple pie. This was all 1 order. Luckily it was postmates so i got it all free..but come on guys, get it together. It's not a hard job."
151,"Setup moving and cleaning about 3-4 weeks in advance.  Jason, was excellent to work with, however, the day after Christmas came and on the day of our move, we got a call 45 mins before stating that they had 3 people not show up and can we reschedule for the next day. Although they offered 10% off, then 20% off the total bill, I wasn't going to be left high and dry again. Seemed to be a good company until the day of service."
152,"***ROACHES*** ***Infestation***
I sat down to eat my plain cheeseburger they added everything but the meat paddy! I returned it. It was not busy but took them 7 minutes at a fast food restaurant. 

When I sat down I looked at my partner and I saw next to her a Roach in the corner booth. I saw a roach and told her. She jumped back. I looked back in disgust. Never have I ever dined with bugs sitting next to me! 
When I looked over to my right there were roaches swarming the corner around the leather. (Going in and out this is disgusting!) Action needs to be taken!!"
153,No Ice for the third straight week..... Really? Come on Taco Bell you're better than that
154,"This place was terrible! Not that I expect a ton or great service from a fast food place but this was bad. Rude employees, cold food, limp fries, etc. And let's not forget they don't have a kids menu so they recommend some adult garnished burger that was giant for a child!"
155,20 minutes waiting for the worst chicken wings. I guess they dont want people to go back. And not cheap for the quality.. never again.
156,STAY AWAY... I'm only giving this Taco Bell a one start because I can't give a negative star. We went at 10:30pm lobby close drive through only. Order was wrong. We ordered 3 #10 and 1 #11. I'm still trying to figure out what we got. The food was cold like it was cooked hours ago. If you had lettuce it was wilted. The taco shells were suppose to be hard shell but they was busted up and so soft like the food was prepared hours ago. Definitely was not freshly cooked. Absolutely the worse Taco Bell I have ever been to. Absolutely Disgusting and disgraceful to serve food like that to the general public. I hope my family don't end up with food poisoning.
157,Stopped by to order an 8 piece original dark meat and they had no original chicken ready. Would be a 16 minute wait. Really?
158,"The worst customer service ever. The cook didn't know English or Spanish because the woman tried to communicate with me in Spanish, but she didn't know both. I told her how I wanted my subway and she made whatever she wanted. After she tried to be an smart ass and said that she wasn't able to understand my English when I was born in this country  anyway Gente india"
159,Been here many times and my order is messed up every time. Tried giving them the benefitt of the doubt but I think its just ineptitude. Poor or nonexistant manners as well.
160,"This is not a restaurant, it is a scam. They get people to order food and never deliver it hoping to get away with the money."
161,"This is not only the worst McDonald's I've ever been to but the most repulsive joke of a food establishment I've ever seen. The staff is rude and the food takes forever. When I got my food I was given ONE sauce so I asked for another and two of the staff looked at me, nodded there heads and looked away and completely ignored me. There were no napkins, no straws, no tea, no lids, the entire building was filthy and disgusting. It looked like It hadn't been cleaned in months. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. If you're on your way there please for your own sake turn the hell around."
162,I can't speak on the food all i know is the late night employees will never serve u breakfast around 3 am i wish someone would fire them!!
163,"My goodness.  I understand that most Burger Kings are terrible, but this one is absolutely horrendous!  All the workers looked like they were dressed to bee in the thriller video, a worker came in and finished getting dressed for work right there in the dining room while the manager put her personal cell phone conversation on hold to YELL loudly at her.  Everyone looked like they were high or recovering addicts. The dining room was so disgusting, we had to just throw our food and flat drinks away. Never again will I eat at that freak show!"
164,"This is definitely the dirtiest restaurant I've been to in ages, I'm almost certain that it's been at least 3 days since anything was cleaned (I mean everything table floor even the windows are really dirty) and the bathroom (men's atleast) has no tp or paper towels. this place doesn't have real ljs food, no fries and the fish and chicken don't match it at all. On top of all of this they were out of BBQ and tartar sauce. Lady up front was bitching about being here at 800 after leaving @ 2:00 last night. I can't see any reason to be here that early because literally nothing is cleaned. My mom got a Dr pepper and said it didn't taste right so she asked the lady behind the counter and she said that we ran out last night. Does this place not use out of order signs? Atleast a heads up would have been nice. Worker finally leaves to do something *refills straws* and goes back behind the counter and talks to some guy. Wow."
165,"Went inside to get take out, less than friendly greeting, long wait, and how do you run out of tarter sauce before 5pm! No apologies, no thank you no repeat business. The one star is very generous."
166,They had a Taco Pizza on the menu so I ordered it and was told they actually don't ha e that pizza.  Well...why is it on the menu?  Geez...
167,I would rate this no stars if I could.  Order was missing items and wrong.  Was told it would be replaced but after waiting 1 hour with no word we called to check.  Was told by very rude manager Daryll that it was not going to be replaced and no refund would be goven unless we returned the wrong items.  Such poor customer service its hard to believe.  We use this location often and have had a few errors but never anything like this.  Please think twice before using this location.
168,Absolute worst McDonalds in America. How do I walk in on a Friday night at 6 pm and they say we don't have any fries. It's probably the busiest time of the day. Then I finally get my order 15 minutes later and it's wrong. Not to mention the fries are spilled everywhere with about 2 in the fry container
169,"This Mcdonald's sucks. The workers forgot our hashbrowns, couldn't make oatmeal decently, and couldnt even fill the coffee cups all the way. These clowns want $15 an hour but aren't worth their pay."
170,"2/2 visits they've been out of chicken. 

Terrible food quality. Terrible service. 

I can't even comprehend how this is tolerated in such a well known, successful company and brand."
171,"Went there on Wednesday at 7:47pm.  There were four people in line.  At 8:13pm, the manager declares that there are no more chicken sandwiches even though there are still 3 people in front of me and 2 people behind me.  How can you run out of chicken?"
172,"My husband and I dined here on Thursday evening, it was late near 10 pm when I picked up my food through drive through. The chicken was dried out in the Famous Bowl and it was very sloppy, potatoes coming out of the sides and gravy in the bag. The chicken little was so hard I could not even bite it and the two chicken breast I ordered were also dried out. I tried to call the restaurant but nobody every answers the phone. My advice is I would not eat at this location late, the food is close to being tossed out and apparently they still serve it to guests."
173,"This is not only the worst taco bell I've ever been to, it's the worst fast food spot i've ever been to period. The staff is awful, I had an employee SNAP at me once for asking if she could hear me in the drive thru. Awful attitudes. The food is ALWAYS cold and takes foreverrrr to get, and they always forget at least one thing in my order. Never go here."
174,If I could I would give this location negative stars. We we called and told our food was on its way. 45 minutes later we called to inquire why it had not been delivered. After talking to 3 people we supposedly got a manager named Alex. He told us he was short handed and the guarantee of hot food did not apply to them. This was the third time we gave them a chance and received cold pizza for the third  time. This place should be closed. The employees are incredibly rude including the manager. We will never give them our business again. I can't believe they are still open. Worst customer service I have ever come in contact with. I hope the corporate office sees this and we receive a surprise HOT pizza like the commercial. This food is not even edible.
175,"Can you  believe that I have gone to this store twice in two weeks.  Last was Sunday  a.m. before  going to church and when I paid,  they don't  have change. That they asked me  was it ok.  They short me 1st time four cent. This Sunday it was nine cent. When I said no! The cashier  got offened and walked away. Mgr came to register  aggressive  and said here's your  5.00 back. You don't have to come here again.  On top of that, it was a female worker with red hair eating a sandwich at the  counter while on her sell phone.  Totally  ghetto  staff"
176,"Wow, I wish I didn't turned in here to pick up food. Sitting in the drive thru for 20 minutes just waiting for my order but too scared to honk cuz I don't want my food to be spat on."
177,"Went to just get an MCCHICKEN WITH ONLY CHEESE N GOT EVERYTHING ON IT THIS MY THIRD TIME COMING bk within an hour,bring it back and the cooks n manager got attitudes like why get mad at me fa wat yall did wrong just bad service and people tht cant read english well,thy need not b fixing food #justsad#needtofixthat# AND DIDNT GET A FREE PIE OR ANYTHING 
#gtfoh# HOW CAN U MESS UP A PLAIN SANDWICH?HOW?"
178,"The worst place to eat EVER!!! I ordered food & they took the money out of my account and NEVER delivered it. When I called them they told me I  should get the food in an hour & 2hrs later I called and they blamed it on traffic. They lied and told me it was on the way & I should have it in 30mins, and hour later I called and the customer service was horrible. They just picked up the phone yelling telling me I was gonna get my money back... and hung up the phone in my face. I never got to say one word to them during the call before they hung up... it took me 48 hours & contacting my bank to get my refund... I will NEVER EVER make the mistake of giving my business to this horrible place, even if it was the last place on earth...I'd rather starve"
179,Worst McDonald's ever!! They take forever and are rude. I never write reviews so you know a sis really not about it! They all need a whole new staff training because they suck
180,"Cars. parked all over sidewalk,  young people hanging around outside smoking blocking entrance, very uninviting. I can see why the previous rating was bad because it seems it is more of a hangout than a place preparing good food."
181,"Do NOT go to this KFC!  Zero quality.  I've attempted to pay the additional price for white meat over the thighs twice and they did not fill the order.  When you go inside to get it corrected, they look at you like they can't comprehend what you're saying and tell you that you have to call the 800 number.  Today I opened my order to find they've forgotten the gravy."
182,Shoutout to these people who want $14 an hour but can't put any sauce in my 20 piece nuggets! Even though we asked to make sure they were in it. They aren't. Sad.
183,"Bring a chair cos you'll be waiting for 15 min or more to get your food. Breakfast sandwich, good luck. Might as well go to Dunkin donuts up the street or just wait for a while."
184,"This place deserves ZERO stars. Order was placed on Grubhub at 6:30pm, called the restaurant at 8:30pm and was told that our order is coming, they are running behind;"" The order status was changed to ""delivered"" at 9:30pm when it was NEVER delivered. We contacted Grubhub and they called the restaurant from another line, the restaurant blatantly lied and said the food was delivered. DO NOT TRUST THIS SCAM of a restaurant. Will not order from this place again."
185,The chicken is good but they will cheat you; I got 2 drumstick wings instead of 2 chicken legs in my 12 piece bucket.  I'm done because they don't answer their phone and it was an obvious attempt to deceive.
186,"This is the slowest place ever! You can't even consider it fast food at the rate they serve it. 

That being said it's an average McDonald's in terms of quality it's fine."
187,"Made an order on Grubhub October 2, 2018 since they were the only ones listed who would deliver through the service. After two hours of not receiving my order, I tried calling the number listed. I called thirteen times and I was either hung up on or no one ever answered. I finally called Grubhub to confirm the number (it was right). She miraculously got in touch with someone and told me they were really busy and my order was running late. No big deal, just wish someone had relayed that info to me. On the third hour, after trying to call that number and being hung up on or not answered AGAIN, I called Grubhub and cancelled my order and told them my issue. I'll never try this place. I understand busy, but you can have the courteous to call your customers and let them know. And I wish I had read all the reviews of food never showing up before I placed my order. Terrible business."
188,They aren't following covid guidelines and safety precautions. Barely anyone was wearing a mask. Rude staff who refused to be helpful. I asked for a refund because the young lady handling my order had her mask around her chin the entire time and wasn't wearing gloves when touching my food. No gloves and no hand washing touching fries as she put them in the bag. The cashier was also not wearing a mask.
189,"This place is the worst McDonalds in the world. I know that sounds hard but this place is run by total morons, it is disgustingly dirty, the wait times are atrocious and the food (which should be exactly the same as any other McDonalds) is untasty and tossed in the bag like it was made by mentally deranged criminals."
190,"I'm a DoorDash driver, I recently got a job to pick up an order for a customer at this location. I waited 30 minutes to just pick up apple slices and a 10 piece McNuggets meal. People came in after me and got their orders quicker, and they were much bigger.  I didn't even have to eat here to know the experience of just being here is so terrible"
191,This place is nasty & the employees are lazy. They don't have napkins out in the lobby & the lobby is dirty.
192,Order a cheesy bread stick online and it said to be ready at 12:55-1:00 when I got there it still wasn't done and had to wait another 15 mins for it and when I recieved it there were barely any Italian season on it and my breadsticks did not look appealing at all. Had to be the worst Italian cheesy bread stick I had..will not be goin back to this location for it.
193,"Ordered a pizza. Called the store 30 minutes after the estimated delivery time for the pizza. The person who answered the phone said they couldn't provide me with any timeframe for when the pizza should be here, except that it would be ASAP. Again, mentioned the time given for ""ASAP"" passed 30 minutes ago. Got the pizza 45 minutes after the estimated delivery and the slices were cut completely all over the place."
194,"I'm at Pizza Hut and there is nobody attending me and i had to wait 15 min for someone to come and attend me and they finally did cause I had to come to where they cook to tell them I'm waiting, but the girl was on her phone and doing nothing and when she came she had a big attitude."
195,"If I could this place negative stars I would! I order food and an hour later these incompetent people called me back saying they were closed and weren't delivering my food anymore. First they tried to say they were on the way and couldn't find my address although it was only 2 blocks away from their location, then when I explain to them where my address was they come up with a new story about how they are tired and they don't feel like delivering my food. (It was. Nowhere near closing time) Do not order from here !!!!! These people are rude and racist."
196,"WORST SERVICE EVER!!!! Waited in the drive thru at least 30 mins just to place my order, the manager that took the order ABSOLUTELY HATES HIS JOB!!!! All attitude. Finally get to the window after another 15 mins, food is STILL not ready, there are uber eats and/or door dash guys standing outside the drive thru window waiting for food, note I said STANDING outside of the window, which is a safety hazard. There was no control over what was going on. The manager again with the attuitude, when asked for my receipt, he gave me the wrong one with more attitude, finally after waiting another 10 -12 minutes I get my food which was a happy meal with cold fries. Absoutely avoid this Mc Donalds if at all possible."
197,"DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE !!!!
I am not kidding when i say these people are lazy. It could be 8pm and just to not serve milkshakes or Mc floris they will tell you their machine is broken. THEY ARE LIARS because during the day they serve them but any time after 8 it's ""broken"" ? Not only that but they constantly get orders wrong and I've been inside and it's completely disgusting.."
198,"Not to add to the bad reviews, but they really pissed me off and thankfully Eat24 was able to cancel my order in time 

Order two pizzas and a salad for the guys who helped me move into my house. I told them not to worry about lunch, it was on me annnnnd apparently not. I put an order in about an hour and half before hand. Set it to have it delivered by 230, ok everything seemed fine. An hour goes by I want to check on the order and it told me it was ""pending"" ok, fine. I tried to call the restaurant multiple times and no answer. As 2pm was approaching, I saw my order was still ""pending"" I got nervous, called Eat 24 and asked if they can get a hold of them  They tried to call the restaurant for me with no luck and cancelled my order. I then read all the horrible reviews and it all made sense! Wish I read them before I placed an order.   I don't understand how this place is still open! Horrible customer service and communication! Never ordering from them! Save yourself the headache and the 1Star experience and order from someone else with a better reputation."
199,"I wish I could give this location zero stars.  If I were the owner of this KFC I would be appalled and embarrassed to be associated with it.  This must be a case of the owner living out of town and not caring AT ALL.  We were there on a Sunday morning 30 minutes after they opened for the day.  It was FILTHY.  There is a rolling trash container by the counter and from our table I could see underneath it and it was unswept and littered with old debris. It is on WHEELS and had clearly never been rolled away to be swept under.  Same with the beverage area.  Underneath it, clearly visible from our table, it was dirty and littered with old debris.  The floors around other tables were also filthy with crumbs and debris. The first table we sat down to was sticky  and we had to move.  They been opened for 30 minutes and it was empty when we arrived. So this was clearly left over from not only the day before, but by the looks of everything, MANY days before.  I should have looked at the reviews before we went in, but we were getting our tires rotated next door, so it seemed a convenient place for a fast lunch.  Now I am worried I will get sick from what is clearly an utter disregard for basic cleanliness.  Please don't eat here.  Why neither the owners nor the management seem to care about the state of this place, I can't comprehend.  But if the dining room looks this bad when you are the first people in when they open for the morning, imagine what the food prep area must look like.  No one cares here.  We will never be back and will tell everyone we know in this area no give this filthy place a HARD PASS.  Owner, please take some pride and take control."
200,"Stopped in this place for a Happy Meal on 05/16/2019. 

I can't believe this is an actual McDonald's! At first I thought that it must be a knock off one like the one in that movie, ""Coming to America"" w Eddie Murphy from way back. ""McDowell's"" or something like that it was called in the movie. At least the one in the movie was clean. This one, it's absolutely the worst one that I've ever been in or even heard about!! Exceptionally dirty! Were those bug zappers on the walls? It's attached to a filthy,  blown out BP gas station. I. Just. Couldn't. Believe. This. Place. 

McDonald's Corporate, what do they have on y'all that you can't shut these guys down? Seriously, it truly shocks me that the City Health Department hasn't closed this place down. During the 20 minutes that we waited for our food we looked and looked for a Food Safety Rating but couldn't find one. 

Stay. The. Heck. Away."
201,Absolute slowest service ever. Waited in the drive thru for 20 minutes for a happy meal and the order wasn't even right. If the inside is going to be closed at least have enough help to keep a drive thru moving. SMH
202,"Racist...we were treated horribly. Absolutely horrible. Do not eat here. The owner was not nice at all-he looked mortified when we walked in but we just assumed he had a busy day. We were wrong. He didn't even want to take the order... He literally stared at us, took a doop breath, and reluctantly wrote what we wanted. We should have left but we didn't-bad judgement. We paid and waited...half our order was wrong. Then we got it correct but it was half done. The chicken fingers were not done in the middle and the cheeseteak had hardly any meat-& i paid for extra meat. We asked to use the restroom to wash our hands and we were told there was no restroom available. Then a younger Caucasian woman walks in, asks to use the restroom without buying anything, and is immediately taken to the restroom. We left at that point. It's sad because it is a great location but disappointing because the last thing you expect coming into that establishment is racism...."
203,"My family and I always order double pepperoni and extra sauce for one pizza and donair for the other, most often we get the pizza from this location but when we do there's  close to one pepperoni per slice the donair pizza looked like it had two pieces of meat on the entire thing. 
It's almost like the person responsible for doing this thinks if they add the toppings the customer asks and pays for that it will be a bad thing, perhaps they think each additional topping will be deducted from their pay??? I don't know why they constantly do that but I would like to start receiving the pizza we ask for and not what some cheap half wit pizza maker thinks is what I want. Definitely do not recommend this location until they learn to listen and act."
204,I wish I can give this place 0 stars 99% of the workers there look like they need to go to rehab and act like your there asking for free food they need to fire everyone there disgusting attitudes  an horrible service
205,"Horrible. I ordered at 8:30 and after it being over 45 minutes, I called and they said it was on it's way. I called again after 60 minutes late, and they said it never went out even though they had received the order at  8:30. Got a full refund through Grubhub. Hate this place, don't order."
206,"In the words of my 16 year old daughter...""ew"".  To call it gross would be offense to grossness.  The employees stare at you like they're ready to fight.  Apparently they're paid by the number of words spoken as they do more stating than interacting.  The food was fine which is factored into the rating of 1.  Here's the worst part.  I foolishly decided to use the restroom.  Apparently something died in there...2 years ago...is still decomposing...creating smells I didn't know were possible.  Apparently 9 of 10 patrons (or as I suspect employees) miss the toilet.  The bathroom door doesn't lock.  There are no paper towels or functional dryer.  The soap dispenser was apparently torn down in the late 70's.   Ew."
207,"They take doordash orders, in person orders and phone orders, with one cashier, if you want food from here be ready to wait 30-45 mins."
208,Worst pizza hut ever this is my second bad experience there never again my chicken was raw.
209,"This is the worse Pizza Hut ever. Manager Melinda Ridley was rude as fuck after they said they attempted delivery at my house, but really never showed up. I've given these guys way too many chances. They aren't aren't burning our pizzas, they aren't delivering on time or not delivering at all. I'm not stopping here, I will be calling corporate on this location"
210,"Since I have to rate it one star for the win...... first off, I contacted McDonald's about this place and haven't heard back at all. This particular store has no identifying manager so I'll say it's self run by the employees and it needs a manager badly, the staff is rude, the food gave me a trouble stomach bug for dayssss and I mean days!, hygiene needs to be a serious priority at this establishment as well as customer service , safety sanitation, work ethic."
211,"Well to start off... delivery service is horrible. Waited 1 hour and half for our meal and they are 6 blocks away. I know I could have picked it up but was chilling watching football.  After all that wait the Stromboli was mediocre. Plain chicken Stromboli, no onions, peppers. Was just warm... the fries were hot.  Won't be ordering here anymore."
212,"This Taco Bell is a disaster. You're better off fishing for your food in the river. I'm not sure what they gave me at the drive thru - I ordered soft tacos, but instead received stale soft taco shells full of disappointment - or rather, hardly full of anything. There was hardly anything in the tacos! I'm not even sure they were tacos either, whatever was in there certainly didn't smell like taco meat. I mean, it's Taco Bell and the food is cheap so I didn't bother turning around and going back to complain about it (I took one brave and expectedly regretful bite and threw it away) but it's definitely a far cry from your typical Taco Bell fare. I wouldn't visit here again unless I had a craving for sadness and regret."
213,This has to be the worst McDonald's ever. The people who work here don't ven know what they are doing and they look at you like you came from another world. I have nothing against new people in training but if you are in busy hours just have people that are already trained at the counter. I waited 50 minutes for two hamburgers. Incredible. Not coming back to this location.
214,This location should be shut down by the health department.  Raw greasy chicken.  Nasty staff (attitudes).
215,It's a shame because there wings are the best in my opinion in the area and they have good cheesesteaks. My problem is they always take 2 hours to deliver my food. 2 hours. I can understand one but c mon. This has happened three times already and I'm really tired of it
216,I order delivery from this location now less and less     When I have ordered the last few times I have not received my gift cards or movie passes. My delivery last night included a steak Caesar where they threw the meat on the salad and then the dressing and croutons on top of it making the dressing slimy to hold and also how is this food safe?? I will let you judge by the picture if you would want to eat this.
217,Placed order and at 8:50 pm they called and said order is being delivered. At 9:30 pm I called 10 times finally getting through explaining that I will not except another cold pizza from this location. The store manager indicated he's under staff and if we want a hot pizza we would have to drive to his store and the insurance as advertised doesn't apply to his store. Pizza arrived at 9:45pm.
218,One word: slow. They move at a turtle pace here. I'm not even sure customer service is in their dictionary.
219,"Very poor service, and I mean poor. You'd except with the location, the service would be near excellent, but the effort is lacking. And I agree with the review below; it's not the once-in-a-while mess up, but it's the frequency that it happens that gets me."
220,"If you know what is good for you, you will avoid this place like the plague. A late night craving for junk food brought me to the drive through where I found a long backed up line of cars that wasn't moving because staff inside decided that they didn't feel like taking orders. They made excuses like ""we're doing a shift change"" and that the ""headset was broken"" (then how are you communicating with me through the speaker?). After at least 15 minutes the relented and finally took the order. While waiting for the order we watched the person working in the drive through window open the window and scream at a person passing by ""I'm going to f*****g kill you!"" which left us absolutely stunned. We waited nearly 20 more minutes for the food, and when the order finally came out it was, of course, wrong. The employees only yelled at us and refused to fix it, so we just left and complained to McDonalds. The manager's mediocre response was, ""I'm sorry you feel we have let you down."" McDonalds corporate should shut this place down."
221,"This McDonald's is the worst restaurant on earth. I've never seen such disrespect , ignorant , non courteous people. Did I mention it's a haven for drug dealers and addicts alike . Even the employees are copping drugs . The neighborhood could be better if this place closed."
222,"Hands down, the filthiest place I've ever been in. We were there for coffee and the drink area was coated with spilled drink on the counters and discarded trash. After 10 minutes, a girl came out, presumably on her break, to fill her drink and just took a napkin and wiped it down. Nothing to clean or sanitize it."
223,If I could give it zero stars I would. They never get the order right and right when you pull up they always ask you what you got and they be acting like they don't believe you lol so they ask for the receipt! Then all my fries were all over the bag... then the ice cream machine is always down or broke I'm sick of it !!! Lol
224,"UPDATE: I added a screenshot of the owner calling my order fake. This is how he treat his customers. Don't order from here unless you want to be treated like shit. ------- 
So I ordered by phone 2 hours ago and I'm STILL waiting for my food. I thought it would've been a fast delivery since we're only 8 blocks away. I called an hour ago and he told us our food was on the way. It's a 9 minute drive and he's telling us the food the food was on the way an hour ago?! This is ridiculous. The worst delivery I've ever had."
225,"I haven't been to this spot since it was Georges Pizza so I wanted to give the new ownership a try. The cheesesteak and fries were good and the cook who may have also been the owner or manager was the only professional person in there. There was two other workers behind the counter who look like they might've been in there early to mid twenties. And they were cursing from the time I ordered to the time I got my food. One was a female working the register and the other was a male basically just standing around but he did answer the phone a couple times. The female wasn't that bad but every other word out the males mouth was profanity. Sadly the cook didn't bother to stop them. 

I may order from there again but I definitely won't be stepping foot into that place.

Yes we're in the hood but come on...this is a business!"
226,"This place is so slow and they always get the order wrong like Jesus, and they'll have 10 workers, it feels like hours"
227,"Come to this location too much NOT to 
Receive customer service I never get 
Napkins with my order yesterday I had 
To wait like 5 minutes for my order so I
Decided to add a item .. .but nooooooo
They told me to go to the back of the line
And start over I told the manager she definitely 
Was taking her job way to serious ..."
228,They make you wait even though no one is in line.. then you order. And wait ridiculous amount of time for your not even apologizing for it. That's for starters.  The only thing that was hot was the cheese sticks  fries chicken poppers were not hot. But I guess that's to be expected
229,Got in drive through line at 9:35 pm (store closes at 10pm). Two cars were in front of me waiting to order. By the time I reached the intercom to place my order it is 9:50 I am told Long John Silver's is no longer taking orders because it's almost time for them to close. If a sign advertises a specific time food should be served and orders placed up UNTIL that time.....
230,"This McDonalds used to be one of the best in Philadelphia, but has seriously gone down hill. The manager JoAnne actually wanted to charge me for ice that I put in my own cup. (As an FYI I usually have Ice in my INSULATED cup but I hadn't filled it up and just fill the cup I get from them with tea to put in it) 

This isn't a problem at the two McDonalds in South Philly or any other McDonalds that I've been to. So I didn't expect it to be an issue here, especially since I've frequented it often for the past 25 years."
231,I ordered online for the free whopper with a CH'King sandwich. Never received the whopper. Can't refund and redo an online order and store workers will tell you to take it or leave it. The the Spicy CH'King Deluxe I supposedly ordered was to come with lettuce tomato and sauce. I paid to add cheese and onion. Instead I received the plain sandwich that is $.60 cheaper without the lettuce and tomato and it instead it had pickles on it.  Additionally I ordered the large combo and it had the small fries which I did notice before I left and I received the how dare you question us looks before they eventually replaced with a half empty large container. Just to add to the humor of it all it appeared they must of ran of napkins at the drive in and were grabbing them out of the dispenser so I received a bundle of packing material at the top of my bag. Never go here. Very apathetic workforce. They absolutely do not care.
232,My family and I have ordered from this location several times just to give them the benefit of the doubt. I know that no one is perfect and that places are busy. But EVERY single time food has been ordered for delivery it takes well over the estimated delivery time. I will say though that the food is always hot. My suggestion is not ordering delivery from this location and just pick it up.
233,"I ordered online for the fishers location, when I went to pick up they seemed confused and then started getting my order together. I was given the wrong kind of chicken and wrong sauces. When I got home I realized the fries were soggy and the chicken was inedible. The breading was wet and the chicken was tough. The biscuits were raw on the inside. This was the worst fast food I have ever had."
234,"Chaos. Things seem to happen accidentally if at all. Still, it's a McDonald's and there is some sameness imposed by the structure of the franchise."
235,"Once again sadly proof that some people don't deserve a livable minimum wage. Order a Big Mac, specified NO lettuce twice. Get the burger - covered with lettuce with ALL the sauce mixed in. Brain dead."
236,"Yo, I ordered ONE thing. Grilled chicken sandwich no mayo. The guy hands it out and says that there's NO MAYO. Guess what, there's fucking mayo on it. Called the store twice because I don't have time to go back up there and get a new one, no answer. This place is pathetic lmao."
237,Horrible is an understatement. Called for delivery and told them I'm paying with debit. After waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes the guy is here with no debit machine. He said he will be back so I waited in the lobby for 15 minutes and he didn't show up so I went back upstairs to my apartment. I open my order and realize it's Hawaiian pizza and I don't eat pork. Anyways the driver calls me after an hour (3:00am) when I was sleeping hungry!
238,"DONT NOT PAY WITH DEBT/CREDIT CARD !!! 

This location has someone who hacks debt/credit cards and then will go next door to the gas station and charge it to your card. I thought I got the situation taken care of the first time they charged $75 to my account but the bastard still has my account number and is now making more charges. I will find you ya scum !"
239,By far today was the worst experience ever I had to get my entire order corrected I guess they didn't feel like given out eggs and cheese today because none of my sandwiches had it on there
240,"***ROACHES*** ***Infestation***
I sat down to eat my plain cheeseburger they added everything but the meat paddy! I returned it. It was not busy but took them 7 minutes at a fast food restaurant. 

When I sat down I looked at my partner and I saw next to her a Roach in the corner booth. I saw a roach and told her. She jumped back. I looked back in disgust. Never have I ever dined with bugs sitting next to me! 
When I looked over to my right there were roaches swarming the corner around the leather. (Going in and out this is disgusting!) Action needs to be taken"
241,"Since Shenaniganz/Porky's/Ocean 41 burned down, Oasis takes the crown as the worst bar in Apollo Beach.  Loud, cheap, scummy - a dive bar without the appeal of a divey place.  Always fun to see the parking lot on Sunday morning there, and just how many Bud Light bottles are left everywhere.

The DJ only plays butt rock, so if you're a fan of late 90's Limp Bizkit, you've got a new place.  Although if that's your favorite type of music, you most likely already work at Oasis."
242,Everytime i go to this McDonald's they give me the order wrong  make sure yall check before leaving and then they make a face when you tell them.....wouldn't come here anymore
243,"This review is more for the owner of this location, not the quality of the food or service, because neither was provided.  But I did try.  As you will see below, the employee working the drive through could not even be bothered to answer the intercom, so I drove away.  I would also recommend that everyone else do the same until this place hires employees that actually want to be there, work, and wait for it....be pleasant.  What a concept, huh?  And again to the owner of this location-if you are wondering why you only have an average 2 star rating,  I am going to do you a solid-no charge.  Have you ever been served anywhere, by any type of business, and been serviced by an apathetic employee?  You know the ones I'm  talking about, they hang their head, have a look of disgust on their face, move slower than a snail, and overall act like the customer is annoying them.  And then they think they deserve $15/hr for just showing up for work even though in my experience they screw up the order at least half the time? Let me tell you what everyone else already knows-they are not worth minimum wage let alone $15 hr.  If you know what I am talking about, then you might want to know you have a young girl working the drive through, at least she was tonight (10.6.18 at approx 6:30pm).  Although I have been to this location many times in the past (no more though, this was my last time), it is normally to dine in and not drive through.  This time I decided to use the drive through to save time, but after sitting at the order station for 5 minutes, asking multiple times if anyone was there, AND with at least 6 cars in line behind me and not wanting to be perceived as the hold up, I decided to just to drive away and go to Chic-fil-a because the food and service is impeccable, they are just a little further away.  I dont know if any of the people behind me drove away also, but as I drove past the girl manning the drive through window, she gave me the disgusted look, even though she never even said one word to me while I sat there all that time asking to be served.  Probably just as well, the gall of me actually expecting to be served, could very well have resulted in her splitting in my food.   And to be honest, there is a Mikey Dees right next door to the Chick-fil-a down the road, which by the way has much better food for the same price, and I have never had these issues with this other McDonald's employees. I guess the moral of this story is that there is a reason why some businesses get 2 star reviews and others get 4 or 5 star reviews-most of the time it centers around how the employee treats the customer.  In my case, I drove to the Mickey Dees that was a minute closer to me, I will definitely NOT make that mistake again.  For those of you thinking of going to this Mcdonalds, you have been warned."
244,Definitely agree with all the other reviews! Especially the zero stars! Went through drive thru at 10:05 pm closing was at 10:30 we ordered steak soft taco and an order of nachos then sat waiting to get to the window until 10:25 when the guy told us they were closing and do not have any nacho cheese! Really why would you wait until I get to the window to tell me this! Then waited another 10 min for the steak soft taco. Drove off and realized it was wrong! The manager told me she only had 2 workers. That is not my problem! Would go out of my way to go to another Taco Bell that has better service!
245,"This place blows, staff is moronic and every order is extremely delayed & screwed up."
246,"A dump would be too nice of a descriptor for this place. Its located in a toilet bowl town so it's no surprise that the citizens and the service you receive are crap. Went in today and tried to order breakfast. 3 hotcakes and a sausage is all I asked for...I was told this verbatim.. ""oh we dont have any hotcakes"", a few seconds later ""oh we have hotcakes"", a few seconds later ""oh we dont have any hotcakes"" a few second later ""never mind"".  I decided it would be yo my benefit if I  just left. And that's what I did.  After that exchange I knew my food was going to be garbage. The most disappointing part is that ALL of the restaurants in this small vicinity of a toilet bowl (all located on the same street) give the same EXACT SERVICE. I think the water and lead levels should be tested...I'm almost positive there are some chromosomal abnormalities in this state."
247,"This is the absolute worst restaurant I have ever been in. The staff is completely incompetent and they have messed up every order I've seen since I've been here. It took 20 minutes to get our food. If your choice is eating here or starving, consider starving."
248,Stopped her on my lunch break to grab something quick it.wasnt quick the drive thru was so slow and I waited 10 to 15 minutes to get my food . I ordered a minute maid slushy it wasnt even filled up the fries were cold and the chicken nuggets were dried out and rubbery tasting.  I do not recommend stopping at this locations food was horrible and the wait was too long
249,"Worst establishment ever. Our flight was delayed so we decided to come in and have breakfast before we left. While there man hanging a advertisement poster inside dropped a flower vase on the table and it shattered he then told the younger guy at the register that he did not know who broke it. When the manager came out, Maria she looked at us with disgust in her eyes and told the younger man to kick us out. We asked why if you were simply they're having breakfast. She stated that they only allow 30 minute dining and that we had to leave . No one else was dining in. She stated McDonald's does not make the rules she does. When we simply explain that we just wanted to have breakfast because our flight was delayed she stated she did not care that we need to get out. Worst customer service, absolutely no empathy or compassion, that's not the McDonald's values I have always known. Avoid at all cost."
250,Honestly...I just wanted an ice  coffee and what I got was unexplainable. I don't know what it is but it tasted like fake syrup with a tiny bit of coffee mix with orange juice. Terrible! The customer service was terrible as well.  Will never come back here ever again.
251,"Worst McDonald's experience I've ever had. I had ordered a chicken sandwich but got a burger instead. I was in a rush so I just accepted the mistake but half way through I noticed there was mold on the bun!  Also ordered 10 nuggets but only received 7! These idiots can't even count. The staff are UNBELIEVABLY RUDE and slow, even by McDonald's in North Philly standards. Going to cut this review short because I'm pretty sure I have to go vomit now."
252,I used ordered from this dump i ordered a double cheese burger some cookies & fries i threw up all theses items because they were cold & uncooked the cookies were raw & undone they weren't brown & golden they were light & disgusting.
253,"The oxtails, rice and beans had no flavor. I got 3 small oxtails that's dry & a platter full of rice. I asked for extra extra gravy they did not give it to me. The cabbage was good."
254,This place is absolutely horrible. My husband went there for our dinner and upon biting into one of my tacos a bug was in it. I called the manager who told me if I brought the taco up she'd replace it. I replied if you think I'm ever eating there again you're nuts. The manager found it necessary to hang up on me. The original person who answered the phone doesn't even know where she works because she answered the phone with the wrong greeting and business name. If I could give negative stars I totally would. I hope they enjoy a visit from the health department
255,"Three times in a row this location has accepted my app order, took my money made our order and then...nothing. It just sits there and they never deliver it. This last time, after an hour we just went up there. No apologies but they did give us our pizzas...the wrong pizzas. Used to be a frequent customer but no more. I don't know if they have new management or no management at all but save your time and your money and go somewhere else."
256,"Bought a breast meal last week at the drive thru.  Server had an attitude as if doing me a favor.  Got home chicken was very dry, not fresh.  This as been going on too long, has to be because of the location.  Won't be back!"
257,"The property is dingy, trash cans stuffed almost to overflowing.  Staff was surly and apparently annoyed by having to prepare food for paying customers.  The fries were a bit sad, like they had been made some 2-3 hours ago, though they did almost taste like Rally's fries.  The Big Buford, which I was certain was my favorite drive-through burger, was limp, dull, and bland; but at least it was served lopsided on a soggy bun.
I hope to retain faith that Rally's as a whole maintains a higher standard of quality.  As for this location, it has left a bad taste in my mouth."
258,"Why does it take soooo long to get food inside? On average, 15 min wait time. I'm not alone. Please fix! I would come here more often if it wasn't for the frustrating experience. It's been like this for years with no improvement. I usually end up at Chick-fil-A which is how fast food should be. I challenge the owner/manager/decision maker to simply study their model of efficiency and take action"
259,No indoor seating and no use of restroom. We went elsewhere.  Realized reading yelp reviews we made the right decision.
260,"The other day I stopped at this location at McDonald's. The drive-in line was long so I went in the store to order. I was the only customer, I waited five minutes to be waited on. The employee never greeted me, took my order and never said a word to me. My order number was written on top of the receipt. Five minutes later a paper bag was put on the counter by another employee. She never called my number, I had to ask her was this number...###.?  The manager of this location needs to talk to his employees about common courtesy they show to their customers. McDonald's employees think they deserve $15.00 dollars an hour? Are you kidding me?"
261,I waited for my food for 1 hour I paid for large salmon and got small portions it was cold and taste horrible the cook didn't have on a mask and she came out front and took care a costumer who didn't have on a mask and went back to cooking.  The greens had more peppers in it than green. When I got home the wrong food was in the bag after waiting an hour
262,"I've never left a review before, but this is necessary. Pay attention to these reviews. I wish I would have read them before placing my order. I was quoted a two and a half order wait time, and it's been an hour after that and I'm still waiting. When I try to call the restaurant, they pick up the phone and immediately hang up. I ordered through Grubhub, and they are currently working on resolving the issue. Don't waste your time."
263,This place is super slow  and rude crew and have wait for 10mintues for my order and food was cold.
264,"We waited 15 min in the drive through to get our food- and then the one burrito in our order was disgusting. Half size than usual, folded messy and burnt rice in every bite."
265,"Not a. It fan of pizza 73, but their wings are always good, until well yesterday 
I also tried their poutine and yucky gravy is not enough thick and gross, and cheese well not enough considering they are using wedges and our wings were disappointing they weren't tossed in sauce just sprayed with a sauce bottle not the way wings are ment to be, as well as the size was a disappointment pizza 73 usually have really great wings now I'm not so sure..."
266,"I just ordered 2 pepper steak platters  with mac and cheese collard greens for pick up when I got there to get the order first I was told they had no greens so i opted to have Mac and cheese and yams  the price for medium platter on their menu is $ 12.00 per platter on the T.V. in the restaurant even states that the platters are $12.00 (WRONG )
 I was charged $14.00 per platter  and then to make matters worst the platters was like we ordered a MAC and CHEESE platter cause they had a lot of that with no cheese and the pepper steak was like eating roast beef there were no peppers in it and the yams was entirely too sweet and then when my husband called the woman wanted to argue with him He told them it was like ordering a Mac and cheese platter with the steak and yams are the sides FALSE ADVERTISEMENT and the food is not worth the money they don't have a large selection of food for now on I will use my gas to go else where"
267,"I have lived in a Fishers for 20 years. During that time I visited the prior KFC in ""downtown"" Fishers. 11 out of 13 times, the food was poor quality, cold or otherwise inedible. Had a teenager who Loved KFC and thought it will be better next time. It never was. It was clear, KFC didn't care and I wasn't returning. It's been more than 6 years since. Tonight someone suggested we try the new one. I gave in reluctantly.

Went there and ordered the usual extra crispy chicken bucket. Got regular recipe - again. The slovenly dude at the window was unfriendly, curt, and could care less - typical management material of the past. Handed me a sticky credit card processing machine, then my food. Food was terrible. Wrong recipe. I can't eat the regular because it's too greasy (extra greasy tonight), and I had intestinal surgery years ago. Couldn't eat it. Chicken was warm, service cold, the crappy restaurant of the past is alive and well at this restaurant. I will never eat there again, neither will my guests and neither should you. KFC Fishers - expanding the definition of junk food!"
268,"Words of advice: Don't even think about eating here. 

Either it's broke, they don't have it, or they can't even take your order.  EVERY TIME."
269,More than likely if you go here you'll sit in line   Only to get up to the menu and they say we're closed . 3rd time I've gone and they always look open but half the time are actually closed . When I get lucky and they are ACTUALLY open . Food is always just meh
270,"MY ORDER: 
Fish and 2 chicken combo.
with drink.
RESULT: The idiot at the window said they had no more soft drinks left except Mt Dew and Diet Pepsi.  ORDERED Mt Dew
Also, told me no mac and cheese left, so my sides were the corn and mashed potatoes and gravy.  
Got home:  FISH, 2 Chickens were dark brown, so tough I couldn't bite through any of the 3 pieces. It'll be a miracle if I'm not food poisoned.  The corn was so cold I think it came directly from Freezer and they never even chucked it in the microwave.  The MT Dew was more like Club Soda, had no flavor just carbonated salt.  The Hushpuppies were hardened and a coloration I've literally never seen before.. I took one bite and had to spit it out.  
THIS PLACE IS NOT ONLY NOT RECOMMENDED, IT IS DANGEROUS TO EAT.. You'd be better off just picking something out of a dumpster.  
They stole $11 from me.  Never will go near this disgusting filth again. 
None of those kids working there care if you like the food or it kills you either.  STAY AWAY"
271,"This place food is nasty everyone in there is young and they rush with your order,, ordered chicken wings they were so salty and yo much breading, never ever again will I give this place my money."
272,You should know what you are in for when you order from a fast food restaurant.  I foolishly ordered a chicken sandwich.  I don't know what that frozen minced meat concoction was but it was not chicken.  I was literally sick after I ate it.  I will never eat at a Burger King again.  GROSS
273,"Went there on the 29th of July and order an eight-piece box - chicken only, no sides. When I got home I discovered that there were only six pieces in the box. What do you do? Go all the way back and tell them they only gave you six pieces instead of eight. Once you drive off the lot they can claim anything such as you removed them from the box just to get a couple of more. It wasn't worth my time to go all the way back in rush-hour traffic and chance a commotion being stirred up over two pieces of chicken. In the days of the pandemic, most restaurants are doing drive-thru only. Most people using the drive-thru will receive their order and move on so as not to hold up the line. This makes it easy for employees to rip off their customers, and I feel I was ripped off. And what made it worse was the price I paid...$16.38 for eight pieces of chicken and I only got six. Tell me I didn't get ripped off! I hope this message helps others. If you like KFC don't come to this one. Find another one!"
274,Came through the other morning for drive thru. Had 2 kids and a dog with me and was asked to come inside because they were short handed and didn't wanna do drive thru. Now today had to once again pull around and wait. Finally 10 min and food came out. Forgot my coke lady said she'll be right back. 12 min go by and still nothing. Now I have to get out and go inside with no shoes on. If you can't handle a drive thru don't have one. Needless to say there was only 1 guest inside and you wonder why the business has gone down
275,"Bad service and bad store..i order too much things ,and paid for money, but the store don't give me enough food , such as :no French fries,no large hot tea,no large  iced tea ,no 6 PC buttermilk crispy chicken tenders meal ,,I paid the money,but don't give me them,I am angry and unhappy!!I don't like the store !!!"
276,"Worst Taco Bell I have ever been to. Please do Alton a favor and shut down. This town will be better off without this business. 
It is 10:30 pm and we waited 20 minutes in line. There were 3 cars in front of us. I ordered a soft potato taco, a cheese wrap, and a tostado. I wanted to confirm the tostado didn't have meat in it and the worker was obviously annoyed because I couldn't hear her over the monitor. She repeated the order back and said ""soft taco"". I assumed she meant potato and was too afraid to ask because she was so rude. 
To much dismay I received a meat soft taco. What a disappointment. I know that Taco Bell will never do anything about this, but I hope this review will save someone in the future. 
DO NOT GO TO THIS TACO BELL!"
277,Every time I come to this McDonald's their shake machine never works there a sweet tea taste horrible and is very dirty inside around the drink machine most of the employees or rude
278,"This is a prime example of what happens to a business that lacks the proper management. So many issues with this particular location but the common theme here is the nighttime employee's. Time and time again they show the extreme lack of unprofessionalism. Now most of my dealings have been in the drive thru, but i have on occasion tried going inside. 

I say tried as a few times it has been around 8:00 and they have had the doors locked to not allow people inside. Also they don't normally turn on the outdoor parking lot lights so it never looks like it is even open. One time I had the pleasure of going inside to only be left unattended for a few minutes not even acknowledged at all. I ended up just leaving on this occasion. 

The drive thru is where most of my dealings happen. Most of the time you get greeted by an unfriendly voice that gives off the ""I want to be everywhere else but here"" attitude. Its just the lack of professionalism that really gets to me. From unfriendly greetings, to cussing and flirting with other employees, this is what you have to look forward too by visiting this place. Sometimes you get order correct and sometimes you don't. Just be warned, you are not their top priority when you visit this location."
279,"April 22, 2019. Gave this place another try. Ordered 8 piece chicken. They asked if ok that they had no legs, which we wanted. Then they came back and said never mind. We pulled up to the window and inquired about the chicken legs. They said all is good. We get home, no chicken legs. They are just awful there. Rolls were hard as hockey pucks. 

Prior review. Stopped by to order an 8 piece original dark meat and they had no original chicken ready. Would be a 16 minute wait. Really?"
280,"We ordered a shamrock shake and a chocolate shake. When we pulled up to the first window to pay, the employee very rudely informed us that they couldn't make the shamrock shake because the machine was not working so we settled for another chocolate shake. After sitting in line for thirty minutes we received melted shakes and of course requested new ones that were not melted. The employee snatched the shakes back and slammed the window. After waiting another five minutes, he came back and pushed the shakes into my hands and slammed the window again. We received no apologies for the wait or the melted shakes."
281,"Absolutely Horrible! I used Grub Hub. My food was late and cold. Nothing worse than throwing your hard earned money away on crappy food and service. Food was cold, cheesecake was frozen. I highly recommend not eating here!!!   Rating negative 5 stars!"
282,"As pointed out already, this location is horrible with deliveries. Yesterday I placed an order at 11 am for a 6pm delivery. The pizza was inspected at 5:45 and just sat there. I called at 6:30 to see what was going on and they told me it would be 2-3 more hours. Half the time I order pizza from this location I just end up canceling the order because of the delivery issues."
283,"******zero stars*****
 this is the worst brick oven pizza i have ever tasted.  salt was used as a main ingredient.  do not buy anything! disgusting!  vegetable pizza was thrown away by everyone of my super bowl guest.  this business needs to be sold to someone who knows how to prepare food, period!"
284,We moved to Alton less than a year ago and tried this taco bell several times now and each and every time they screwed something up not to mention how filthy the inside is! They must have the most uneducated morons in town working there..from management on down..I truly believe being stupid s a requirement to get a job there. Every single time they screwed up our order and or charged the wrong price. This place is a joke and we will never go there again!! If you live in Alton and want Taco Bell..go to the one on Homer Adams near Alby..much better!
285,Currently waiting for a extra most bestest and crazy combo. Been here 20 mins. I do not recommend this location.
286,"Literally the worst location I've ever been to.  The place literally smells like ass and is ALWAYS dirty.  The population surrounding it is poor so they never have any of the ""fancier"" items like lattes, smoothies, etc even though they have it on their menus and have the machines to make them.   It's really just burgers, fries and soda here.  I ordered a coffee here and they the woman gave me a sandwich bag with sugar and cream as they don't even have the modern machines where you push the buttons to add the condiments.  Those things were put into McD's over a decade ago.  Never go here."
287,Awful service... Manager sebina is very rube... Walked away from me while i was talking to her several times after her employees screwed my order up. Sat in drive thru for over 20 mins with 4 kids in the car while its 98 degrees outside. Finally after i thought they fixed my order i get home to find out it still isnt correct. I go back up there and im told i have to take the food away from my kids who just waited over 20 mins for to get refunded or for them to do anything... Customer service i called was just as worthless... Lady would only say i apologize. Not sorry or anything else... Just i apologize... Worthless people and i will never return
288,"Horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I will never come here ever again. The service wasn't bad the the food was made sloppy. My sisters cheeseburger had hard bread on top and it was ripped on the side so they had to remake it. After drinking 3/4 of my drink I noticed mold on the side of my cup."
289,"This was probably the WORST McDonalds I've EVER been to. I have no clue how they could possibly be so slow at making nasty frozen food, sure enough their drive through service is absolutely horrific. I'm no sure what is wrong but every other McDonald's I've been to has been better than this. There is no way I would recommend this place to anyone in the world, and the only reason to ever come here in the future is if you're on a road trip and need to go to the bathroom!"
290,"I ended up paying $24 for a breakfast sandwich. When i called the store the man who picked up said "" hey nigger why don't you cry to your momma, this is MCDONALDS."" Really? I mean i guess thats it then.

*disclaimer: paid in cash"
291,"I haven't been to this McDonald's in a looooooong time because the employees here treat food like trash. But I thought maybe it had changed staff but no is stilI a shit hole. I ordered a breakfast burrito one time and got it all smashed good thing I checked before I left and I asked if it could be re-done and it was with an attitude like how dare I ask for my food to been well done when I'm paying for it...and well this time I tried to get a #1 after not coming here for soooo long and I asked for no onions please and Guess what people thats exactly what I got onions it was more of a big mconion as you can see in the picture.
Is like the person that made said oh no onions ok here you go extra onions....to that asshole that did it how about get another job if you don't like your job find something else to do you fucking looser...im done with this place covid19 has nothing todo with bad service this place has always been horrible...Wendy's near this McDonald's is soooooo much better. Dont waste your time and money here not worth it"
292,"Still garbage ..even in the wake of covid 19 and takeout only, with very few customers, they still cant manage to get it right. Warm orange absolutely NO ICE. Terrible customer service and this was with just me and one other person in the DRIVE THRU..the person taking payment had EXTREMELY LONG nails....everyone who eats here runs a risk. They just need to close this one down."
293,Went at noon. Waited 20 minutes and the tenders were cold and as if they were sitting awhile.i know you can do better.
294,"This place sucks, no managers, no general managers, no regional manager,  you are to pay and told to suck a big one and talk to cooperate, guess what, there is no one at cooperate! Never ordering from here again."
295,Just waited in the drive through line for 25 minutes...FOR TWO ICE CREAMS! So slow and rude.
296,Absolutely terrible customer service. Rude at the drive through speaker after we waited 10 minutes for them to even take our order and no one was in line but us. We then pulled up and paid for the meal where we waited another 10 minutes before being rudely told to pull up because our chicken fries were cooking we then pulled forward to wait another 15 minutes to bring the food out. Worst experience I've ever had at a fast food restaurant. Bad enough that my 6 year old asked to never go to Burger King again.
297,Trash. The owner should be ashamed. This takes 30 minutes to get an order of friends. Hopefully people get together soon to make change.
298,"I would give negative stars if I could! Went here Friday night before going to the movies. Big mistake! The fish was so overcooked that it was all crunchy, including the ""meat"" of it. The coleslaw had the consistency of Sludge, the gravy on the mashed potatoes was so cold that it was like gel. I took food back to the counter where the store manager stated that it wasn't like that when it was served to me! As if I had a deep fryer in my back pocket. I threw it out and will NEVER go here again."
299,"CLOSE THIS PLACE DOWN NOW!!!  My GOD! Is this America? I felt like I was in some 3rd world country. Who in The H*** Hires these people? Someone needs to take accountability for this disastrous place. The workers are completely inappropriate. FIRE EVERYONE AND CLOSE NOW! They ARGUE with customers... rude.. nasty... told my kids that they didn't have change for a twenty dollar bill.. our food came up to $11 and some change.. so basically they're saying that they couldn't give us about eight dollars back in any form at all....my kids had to come to the car to explain to me and when I went in to see what was going on..I was met with stupidity.. no explanation...and Oh! Magically they had change. When I walked out to wait in the car for my kids to come out with the food, my kids told me that the workers behind the counter started trash talking me and neck rolling and saying that I'm lucky that I walked out..... Dear Burger King: I [promise] you,  if anybody EVER threatens me in that place ever again, or make my children to feel afraid for ANY reason...You will be placed UNDER the jail. I feel sorry for ppl with No Form of Education. Is that how you plan to spend your life? Behind the counter of Burger King talking sh** and being an (F'ing) nobody for the rest of your lives? pick up a damn book and scratch your way up out of that ghetto mindset. Tragic...."
300,Just like everyone else that leaves a review. These idiots(or the other word if you prefer) never get it right and are rude
301,"Ha. Joke is on me for not trusting the reviews.  But when it's lent and Friday, LJS seems like a good idea in theory. 

We had the longest wait ever for a simple order that started in the drive thru. I then went inside because it took forever to bring the food out. Amazingly and unbelievably they LOCKED the doors to keep customers out because they could not handle more orders.  When someone let us in to pick up our ""drive thru"", the lead person working yelled who let them in?  We are not taking any more orders. 

Wow. Just wow."
302,"Do not call this place!!! I ordered a white pizza through grub hub at this place.They had a 15.00 minimum and a 11.00 delivery charge.I ordered at midnight and didn't get my food until 3am!!! No apology from the restaurant,
 nothing.The food was cold and was awful."
303,"The worst McDonalds I have ever been to. They didnt even take my order at the screen, they took it at the window and had me sit there for 5 minutes before telling me. I waited over 25 minutes for my food and watched all the workers stand around not working.... The person behind me got their food before i did. Never go here, i will never be returning."
304,"Looked into it this place its a scam , the location isn't even a pizza place it's and African clothing store. Don't know how this is even still up saying it's open"
305,"Just went here today one of the best McDonald's I've been to fries were AMAZING! Best I've had in a very long time

Had to revise! The fries were so good I went back for seconds only this time only 15 minutes later they were disgusting a pound of salt nasty flavor inedible, then I noticed my receipt and the drive in front of mines order on the screen.. No matter if you get a small soda or a McFlurry any drink they will add a 50 cent up charge with or without meal that is theft! Also I ordered the first fries with a coupon the second time they charged me $4.09 I think crazy high it's like 2.85 after tax around my way"
306,"Absolutely abysmal.  Rude and apathetic staff feels like they're doing you a favor by taking your order.  Have to pull around and wait for 15 minutes every time because it keeps the ""official"" window wait times good.  Regional manager needs to wise up and realize that the staff here is the worst in the Parish.  I give this place another shot every few months and every single time nothing changes and I'm reminded why I avoid this place.  Wise up and get a manager that can train and control their staff.  

This time I ordered 3 things and only got 2.  I should have known better and looked in the bag before I left.  Not worth the hassle of going back and waiting another 10 minutes for my missing hash browns.

SERIOUSLY, go ANYWHERE else."
307,I don't know why I even bother stopping. I mean you would think after the 500th time of it being crap or having the wrong order I would stop going but they got me by the neck because it's one of the few places on Telegraph. But here I am eating my crap burger without my fry and with a flat dr. Pepper. Place is a joke and the workers arnt of the best breed
308,"First time eating wingstop & will be my last time . It was horrible, everything was cold. Wings were so small & dried out . Can't believe i wasted my money on this garbage. DONT EAT HERE !!!!!!!!! Such a disappointment"
309,"I just came back from a trip to to McDonald's for my kids. I asked for a cheeseburger happy meal with just pickles and cheese on the burger. It had everything on it when I opened it. I got a 10 piece Nuggets with only 9 Nuggets in the box. I asked for extra ranch and they asked me to pay $0.50 for each one, but they couldn't even get my order near right. I didn't ask for any ketchup for my fries but instead asked only for Ranch, and they refused to give it to me without charging me and again I emphasize that they couldn't even get my order right."
310,"YUCK.  Seriously.  I wish I could post a photo so you could see what I got.  I ordered a pizza with DOUBLE EXTRA cheese, olives, tomatoes, and pepperoni.  The cardboard box it came in had more flavor than the crust.  Yes, I tasted it so I would know.  The pizza was burned.  And DOUBLE EXTRA cheese?  Yeah, no.  There is more cheese on a $1 Totino's pizza from the grocery store.  Totino's has better quality sauce too.  I did speak with the store manager, and he was SUPER rude and unhelpful.  

I wish I had something nice to say about this place because I do try to buy local, and I'm a really nice person.  But there was no redeeming quality.  I'm sorry.

Don't order from here."
311,This McDonald's can never get orders correct. And since the dining room is closed you either have to pull over and check the order (defeats the drive through) or hold up the drive through.
312,"went there to pick up lunch for employess today
have about 5 separate orders
one of the burger king employees behind the counter said
she should of gone to fkn mcdonalds with all those orders

really"
313,They have very rude staff and offers very bad service. In addition to that my last visit included being accused of lying about my order resulting in me being charged wrong.  Fun times.
314,"Ok they mess my order two weeks ago ,and I call the store back to let them know .. we'll the manager said come down on your next fee day .. I did today and those folks over at this restaurant made me paid for my food and then give me free food .. I didn't want the food I just want my meal at a discount rate .."
315,"If there is a Burger King in the world, that is worst than this one, I have yet to experience it. How are they still in business?"
316,"We went to wing stop and spent $70 on food. The really short girl that was reading me off the food I bought had a attitude. Then I wait for the 4 drinks I bought. I just heard her talking under her breath saying ""I don't have to be here"". And then threw down my drinks on the table Smh. I never experienced  this customer service in the last 6 years I been in Levittown.  Also the wings are much better at baileys bar."
317,"Warning, Taco Bell Springfield, TN has an employee not returning credit cards thru the drive up. Then going across the street at Walmart making changes until account in drained. Management was advised Three  hours after it happened wouldn't look at video to try and catch employee. Management didn't care are help."
318,"Absolutely horrible and would never order again. There were discrepancies with the order and I was yelled at and talked to in a rude tone being told ""I could not complain about more than one aspect of our meal and I could only pick one thing to be upset about"" and then he proceeded to tell me how incorrect I was and how the wings being inedibly rubbery were based on my personal preference, rather than the sheer fact that they were completely over cooked. I would NEVER order from the restaurant again or give them my business based on how I was treated and that alone. Regardless of the fact that I made a complaint on one aspect of my pizza,  which turned out to be me being wrong, I was yelled at and treated horribly and wasn't even able to speak a word in edgewise with him to admit I was wrong due to the repeating ""no you're wrong that's not correct"" yelling at me every time I tried to speak. 

On top of that, $50  spent and just moved to the area and this was our first meal in our new home in a new state and this gentleman completely ruined my evening and refused a refund of any sort and only offered a $20 credit for the horrible food we had already ordered and never wanted to eat again, and I would especially never give my business to someone who treats others in such a manor. Work on your customer service. I've NEVER in my life had an experience like this or left a bad review to make others aware of why they shouldn't give their money to this establishment."
319,"TERRIBLE! Rude, was told my food would take 20 minutes, waited over an hour and they still got my order wrong."
320,"Wow. You would think that fast food restaurants would have their system down by now. Definitely not this one. Yeah, the drive thru was long. But 15 minutes before my order was taken, another 10 minutes to pay, then i get to the pickup window and get asked to park!? Fifteen minutes later I FINALLY have our food. I tell the guy that we ate at a 3 star restaurant last night that was quicker than they are. He proudly replies, ""Yeah. Have a nice day.""  Yeah you too buddy. Get home, mfers forgot my damn fry! 
But unless we STOP going to these places, it isn't gonna change!"
321,"WOW is all I can say about this location! We are a huge fan of Taco Bell in general so it's pretty difficult to disappoint us, but this place sure proved us wrong. Not sure which was better, the unprofessional staff, the dirty tables or the disgusting food. When I say staff, I'm using the term very loosely as staff usually means workers, but there was definitely no sign of work being performed. We were all impressed that this place is still open considering it's being run by rude employees who could care less about the business. Kudos to the manager for not going out of business! You couldn't pay us to eat there again, but congrats for being the grossest location we've ever been to! You've won that award! Round of applause for you!"
322,"Waited about an hour for 1 Italian cheese bread. Every time I would ask about it the employee said ""its coming now"" which was a lie. All of the employees looked & sounded like it was their first day on the job & they didn't know what was going on."
323,"I feel bad about giving this place a one star review, but just like every other review on here my experience was not so great.

A long wait for my order, almost 30 minutes, and it was wrong. When I told them it was wrong they argued with me. Lucky for me I kept the cash receipt and showed them. They were still rude.

Go anywhere else for a burger. Customers shouldn't be treated like an inconvenience."
324,"I stood at the counter for 25 minutes before an employee even came up to take my order, just to find out that what I wanted was discontinued. Even though it was still on the menu. After ordering something, I waited another half hour before getting it."
325,"Pulled up to the window and someone asked if they could take my order. So I told them what I wanted, sat there for a few seconds with no response. Said hello a few times. Nothing. So I just pulled on up. There is a guy in front of me at the time so I waited. When he pulled off, I thought it was strange bc I never saw anyone hand him his order. When I got to the window, there was no one there. Waited 30 seconds or so. Honked my horn.  Nothing. Looked like all the machines were off and had been off for a while. This was about 5pm on 2/17. There were cars in the parking lot that I assume were employees but one was running. We have had a lot of snow in the past few days and expecting another storm to come through. So it seems they shut down early but maybe left some sort of automated message on by accident. Complete waste of time!"
326,"One of my favorite foods... Wings.
Unfortunately, not many places around here get them right. Also, unfortunately, Wingstop is a place that did not get them right, although that is their entire business model.

First the good.
-The prices are the same here as the other stores in the area.
-They prepare the food in the window that is given when you order.

The not good.
-The chicken wing (traditional bone-in wings) consistency is very... inconsistent. Half of my wings were done perfectly and the other half was edible but felt undercooked (they were safe to eat, it was the physical texture).
-Eating the wings was like two totally different flavors, the sauce would barely stick to the wings and you would taste plain chicken and then sauce instead of a combination of the two.
-The blue cheese dipping sauce I got was, without exaggeration, literally water. If I dipped a celery stick into the blue cheese and pulled it out, it ran right off it as if I never dipped it at all.

I would not recommend Wingstop and I will not be ordering from here again.

(I would however recommend other local places for wings, these would be Baileys, Pizza Hut, WingsToGo, and Pizza Star. In that order.)"
327,"AWFUL AWFUL PLACE! DON'T GIVE THEM YOUR BUSINESS, THEY'RE RUDE AND DON'T CARE AT ALL ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS OR CUSTOMER SERVICE!! 

Awful place.  Ordered my food on NYE got quoted 45 minute wait when it was actually a 2.5 hour wait.  Took me over 30 minutes to get someone on the phone!  Once I finally got a hold of someone a guy answered and was a complete jerk to me told me even though I got quoted 45 minutes they give themselves a 2-3 hour buffer time he then HUNG UP ON ME MID SENTENCE!  I called back immediately because I wanted to cancel my order and he answered the phone in a very rude tone and said ""what do you want?"" That's how he answered my call! I told him I wanted to cancel my order and he said ""k"" and hung up on me once again.  Just looked at my credit card and they still charged me!"
328,"The worse Pizza Hut, no matter how late your order is they won't give you a refund they just say we will give you a credit, then when you call the next time you have no credit.  Just called for 3 medium one topping pizzas and was told 50.00 .   Worse service!"
329,"I will never go to this subway again or maybe any of them.  I ordered a bowl online and didn't realize it came with ranch. The person I ordered it for is allergic to one of the ingredients in the dressing. The worker was rude and was like that is how you ordered it. The worst  customer service ever refused to remake or return the money, supposedly he is the manager.  I was advised that I should leave a negative review."
330,"This restaurant deserves ZERO stars for customer service and stale cold fries. I encountered the rudest middle-aged female employee there tonight at the drive through since the restaurant closes early. I had two mobile orders, one for me and one for my son. I also had two printed coupons for a free small beverage. At the window, gave her my credit card. Then, I realized I forgot to give her the printed coupons. She told me she already rang it up and to use it next time. I stated that I wanted a refund. She then said in her rudest tone, ""You should of give it to me first."" I kept on apologizing and she mumbled something under her breath and then started complaining to the other employees there. I did nothing to deserve this utmost rude treatment. I asked for her name and she replied, ""You don't need to know that.""  Worst management ever to hire an employee like this."
331,"the Cashier charged me the wrong amount (the total dollar amount for the car behind me). the  cashier did not verify that it was the correct order but simply swiped my card. It get worse as the same cashier says it is not her mistake but mine because I was supposed to know my order.  She started to argue with me until she back off. she did cause a scene for no reason.
hint: It helps if you comfirm what was ordered.
they did correct the problem and refunded on the spot.
I checked the order when I go home and my order was missing food.  My daughters happy was not a very happy. It was missing the toy and her small fries.  
overall, it was a pretty horrible experience.  I would give zero stars if it was not for the fact that the food I did get was able to feed my daughter and I."
332,"Horrible. Not only is the wait time completely ridiculous, but the food is awful too! 2 sandwiches took 40 minutes! The pizza isn't too bad but try getting a sandwich, they will screw it up and once they make u a new one it will taste horrible. Management is also horrible and doesn't know how to handle a customers dissatisfaction and was so incredibly rude. Never again will I come back here and will tell everyone I know never to come here."
333,If -5 stars was an option that's what I would give this place. The dining room is closed so the drive thru was 15 cars deep so when I made it to the speaker I asked which chicken was the freshest original or crispy and the lady said we have been so busy nothing is old. Sad that you have to ask these kind of questions at a restaurant but you do. So when I get to the window the lady tells me they don't have any white meat chicken and it's going to be a 30 minute wait for all white meat 10 pieces of chicken so I asked for a manager who came to the window with an attitude so I gave it back to her and said didn't I just see you outside smoking and on your cell phone and she said yes I've been here all day and don't you think I deserve a break and my response was not if you got 15 cars in the drive thru and no chicken to sell. Needless to say I went down the street to Popeyes and they had chicken
334,"I ordered the medium Mega meal from this location on January 29th, 2021, I got a ham and pineapple pizza and a chicken and roasted tomato pizza with the golden crispy wings. I receive my order from the delivery guy, go to eat it and it's NASTY. Pizza is rubbery and chewy and had barely any sauce, wings are spicy and they look like they've been sitting under a heat lamp for days, old and nasty. I call customer service and they offer to send a replacement. I get the replacement and once again it's NASTY and it's the same exact issue. I will NO LONGER be ordering from this pizza 73 again! Absolutely DISGUSTING. I've never had an issue with this location before. I should've just gotten my money back."
335,"Ordered Dominoes @9:18pm, it's 12:04, no pizza... I called @ 9:50 to ask if they were going to be able to deliver it and they said yes, they were running behind. Called back @11:18 & was on hold for 20 mins. I probably shouldn't have ordered when I saw the wait time was 120 minutes. Oh well, a call to say they weren't coming would have been nice.
Called the next day to speak to a manger, was on hold over 20 mins each time. Called corporate & got this bs response 
No more Dominos at any locations
It deserves 0 stars but I could post with out giving it a sta"
336,"This is the worse Rally's location. If you have about 30 minutes to burn then you will have no problem. Everytime I go here I have to wait at least 20 minutes for food. You are better off going to the location near best buy, they are faster and friendlier."
337,Very bad experiences the three times I've been there. I had to stay in line today extra long for them to then give me an incorrect order. Will not be coming back and encourage others not too as well. Unless you want the wrong food and slow service.
338,"Had a horrible experience. When we received our food and got home it was old cold and stale. We called many times that night but no answer. Then the next day we tried calling again before I drove up there but still no answer. When I did drove up there I ask to have it replaced or a refund they told me they couldn't do anything and that we should of checked are bag or should of came back the same night even when we still had are receipt. So basically at this location you are expected to check your bag for accuracy of order and to check every food item to make sure it's fresh and not old, cold and stale.  We called corporate and they were very helpful. But this Specific  location is horrible. We don't go to this location too often because it seemed like there was always something wrong. But we try to give it a chance every now and then. They really need to consider new management or something at this location. But until then we will never return to this store and won't suggest it to anyone."
339,"Best of luck! I've ordered from these jokers twice and both times the restaurant stopped answering calls 3-4 hours after the order was late, never showed up, and they charged my card anyway."
340,Over cooked wings where like rubber fries not cooked fully screwed up my order over priced should I continue....
341,"If y'all aren't going to do Carry Out take down the fucking sign saying you are.  If its drive thru only then say that on your damn door sign or put a sign up a big sign out front.  Done with you and when the shift manager looks at me and makes a ""pull the door"" motion but then doesn't come unlock it when I do and doesnt open... then screw the whole lot of you. Will not return even after COVID.  Thanks Taco Bell for being there for your customers as usual."
342,I don't usually do fast food reviews but this place is the exception.  You literally only go here because there's never a line I don't understand how the district manager allows this freaking location to stay open! Its by far the worst Burger King in the history of burger kings. Just about every fast food restaurant in the parish is pretty good but this location is a joke! Order and get ready to drive around and wait
343,"I visited this location Saturday, 6/1/19 about 9:30am. Since the drive thru was busy I went inside. The manager working the counter (with a teammember) was beyond gruff and unapproachable. She was unpleasant and seemingly mad at the world (or everyone patronizing her store). I observed orders being fulfilled, one at a time, in the order received. However, a single cup of coffee had to wait for an entire food order from the drive thru to be fulfilled. It makes no sense. Two ladies were waiting for decaf coffee, which had to be brewed. The first lady received hers but the second lady (in her 80's at least) had to wait for the drive thru orders ahead of her to be filled. She'd already waited for the decaf to brew but was now pushed aside for other orders. I mentioned this to the manager, as did 2 other customers. She was SO VERY RUDE to anyone. I understand there are guidelines for order fulfillment but there is also courtesy and flexibility to DO WHAT YOU CAN to make guests happy. Whatever systems are in place for order fulfillment seems to be failing everywhere except the Watson Rd. McDonalds in Crestwood. They have no issues, are ALWAYS pleasant and fulfill orders quickly even when busy. Any other locations in South County can't seem to fulfill orders entirely, work quickly or efficiently, and they CERTAINLY have terrible customer service. No graciousness whatsoever! SKIP GOING HERE IF YOU CAN!"
344,"My family and I order from here quite abit and usually it's good but the last two times, last weekend and today it's been lower quality and It's just not what I'm asking for. Double pepperoni means just that it's pretty easy to follow and understand I would think, one to two pepperoni per slice after asking for double is insulting to say the least. I'm strongly considering not using this location anymore due their lack of satisfying their customer and worrying about a few extra pepperoni shutting the business down. Listen to your customers and aim to please or get out of the business altogether. This would be the third time now this exact thing has happened."
345,"Worst Popeyes ever, the women work on front were rude , no ketchup no utensils, no napkins, are u kidding me ?"
346,"I love Wingstop but the service is always shitty at pretty much every location. I placed an order about 2 hours ahead of time to pick up. I arrived about 5 min after it was supposed to be ready. Guess what? It wasn't ready. I asked how long it would be & the girl responded ""we're about to sauce the wings"" with an attitude. Ok that still didn't answer my question but whatever. They used to show you the order to make sure it was correct but I guess they no longer do that. I waited about 10 min & it was ready. The girl didn't say anything & just placed it on the counter & walked away. I asked another guy working if this was my entire order. I just left without checking anything....MISTAKE. When I got to my destination (I ordered for a few friends) the whole order was wrong. If you want expensive wings, shitty service & the wrong order, this is the place for you!"
347,take your money... tell you to pull around with not one car in the drive thru but you... pull around only to see three other cars waiting for food... every single time i go to the BK in chalmette ‍
348,"I placed a $56.00 order and it got cancelled- now I was to wait 5 days for it to drop from my account- what kind of garbage business is this? If you're not taking orders, I'd suggest you post it otherwise- I'll take my business elsewhere."
349,"Slow, slow and slow! Drive through takes forever.  It's quicker to go apply for a job, get hired and just make it yourself!"
350,"Fellow Yelpers, I say that we declare a war on this location. Our ammunition will be the dollars that we will not spend at this establishment. The war will not be won until the service delivery is drastically improved at this place or the location goes under. 

A secondary objective for this war is to demand an improvement to the drive-thru. Presently, the drive-thru is engineered in such a way which prevents drive-thru customers from escaping the really slow service that this KFC/Taco Bell location is infamously known for. As I am sure that everyone can relate to slow drive-thru service, I am sure that everyone agrees that being able to leave a slow drive-thru line is paramount to reclaiming the few precious moments that life has to offer us. 

During the lunch rush on Saturday Jan 30th 2016, My wife and I decided to get some Taco Bell. We pulled into the unescapable drive-thru. When we reached the drive-thru speaker, the person working the window advised us to ""go ahead with your order."" My wife proceeded with her order, but was then interrupted by the attendant and was asked to hold for a moment. It seems that the drive-thru attendant has some difficulty multi-tasking. My solution for this problem would be to place someone at the drive-thru that does a better job of multi-tasking or, at the very least, teach the attendant who was taking our order to either wait to take our order when she is actually ready or coach the present attendant on how to multi-task. 

Once we actually reached the drive-thru, we were greeted by a very impersonal attendant. Granted, I really don't expect much when it comes to fast-food service. However, a simple smile goes a long way. A smile could even raise someone out of the fast food mire onto bigger and better things. 

To add further insult to injury, our soft-drinks had absolutely no ice in them. I am not sure if this is a mistake on their part in that they gave us drinks intended for someone else or if there ice machine is down and they are purposefully handing out iceless soft-drinks and not telling their patrons. Who knows, maybe this location does it the old school way in which the attendant is responsible for obtaining the ice, but during the lunch rush they didn't feel like stocking the ice receptacle. 

Since I am reviewing this location, I will have to advise all would-be patrons to avoid this location at all costs until the service delivery improves. 

Yours Truly, 

Bad Food Critic

~Take it from someone who eats Brain Sandwiches, Pig Knuckles, and Cow Tongue. If I say it is bad, then you can rest assured that it is awful."
351,"Absolute worst service ever!! Ordered a pizza at midnight, and they texted me at 9am saying it was here! Do not order from this place-you'll regret it!"
352,"If Burger King is where you go to ""have it your way,"" this Burger King serves as the chain's nonexample. At the Judge Perez Burger King, you have it their way. Everything―from your wait time to the physical contents of your order―is at their discretion. A Whopper Jr. with no tomato? Sounds like you wanted chicken fries. No? Trust me, sir, I know what I heard. And after you 
do this Burger King's drive-thru's distinctive pull-around-and-wait (an experience as unique as it is inescapable), are you really gonna argue?

I hypothesize Corporate bribes this location to keep their customer satisfaction numbers low and their drive-thru times high. This inflates the performance stats of all other Burger Kings in the district. No other hypothesis explains how a Burger King this consistently bad stays open on Judge Perez, a road with more fast food chains than cars."
353,"Went here for a late night meal. I kid you not, when I got home with the food a cockroach crawled out of my burger. So needless to say this place is dirty, the people aren't friendly. There's always some sketchy things happening outside of the building too. Don't go here."
354,"I hate to squabble over pennies but when you're running a fast food restaurant you should make sure your cashiers know what a quarter is, what a dime is, what a nickel is, and what a penny is because otherwise people will be short-changed.

I would never ever expect quality meals at a fast food drive-thru window. But I was in a rush and I was hungry so I made my order at the Golden Arches.

Someday in the future someone will develop an audible system for driving restaurants where you can actually understand what the person on the other end is saying. Somehow through the mumbling conversation my order was placed; nothing fancy but I did note on the electronic menu that sodas were $1 all sizes and I ordered a large iced tea.

Since I had plenty of change, I decided to pay for the bill which totaled $7.66 by handing the young man a $20 bill, three quarters, and one penny. To those of us who have made it through elementary school math we would understand that three quarters and one penny equals $0.76.  I watched as the young man kept looking at the coins in his hand and then at the cash register and then back at the coins in his hand before he finally placed the three quarters and the one penny in their proper places and he rang up my order. He then proceeded to hand back to me one single dollar bill and two $5 bills but the dime that should have been mine was instead Ronald McDonald's cash registers possession or perhaps the young man kept it as a tip. I had no time to complain ... It was only a dime but my dime plus the dime from the guy before me and the nickel from the guy behind me at another dime or two can add up.

So as I pulled up to the pickup window I'm still wondering about this order and just before the young man at the food window practically threw the food at me I noticed on the bill that the $1 all size soda did not apparently apply to unsweetened iced tea because I was charged a $1.49. Again it's only $0.49 but my $0.49 and someone else is $0.75 and another person's $0.35 does add up to poor management and totally awful customer service.

I realized as I drove away that no one had asked me what to bring sauce I wanted with my McNuggets. It really didn't matter to me because I was going to eat this non-nutritious fried item quickly without a second of considering to savor the taste.  However, If they cared about me as a customer I would have been asked what kind of sauce I wanted but they don't care.

If you're driving through Cherry Hill New Jersey and you're hungry for fast food skip this joint perhaps the king or the bell ringer will have something a little better with staff who understand you deserve to get the proper change when you hand over your money to them."
355,If i could give zero stars. I would. The guy has an attitude and RACIST! they told us they wont serve us food. Racist! wont recommend bad review
356,"I waited 40 minutes to get 5 chicken tenders and the woman at the register was rude, she kept giving me nasty looks when i was ordering. don't waste your time here, go  to china panda across the food court"
357,"I just came from this McDonald's. No one was wearing masks, all had them hanging from their ears. The girl who took payment had a mask and gloves, but the guy who gave me my food and drink had no gloves and his mask was under his nose. I asked for ketchup and he grabbed a bunch out of a tray, again with no gloves. After reading the other reviews about employees not washing their hands gonna throw my food out, afraid to eat it now."
358,"wrote this email to corporate about this store a few months ago... 
In ' Star Wars ' Obi Wan Kenobi used a descriptive sentence to describe a spaceport called Mos Eisley.. The descriptive? ' A wretched hive of scum and villainy ' .... I think if Obi Wan lived in the Antioch area, of Nashville TN, he would use the same words to describe the Mcdonalds located at 331 HARDING PL (I-24)
I've gone here for years as it's convenient to my residence, but after the past week. I'm done. The amount of calls or emails I send to discuss the outright horrendous nature of this store, never do anything to help. I've talked to General Manager after General Manager and nothing ever gets resolved. At this point, I'm thinking this Mcdonalds must be built over an Indian Burial ground.... But, not a regular Indiana Burial Ground, where the spirits come back to cause mischief and mayhem. I think this Mcdonalds was built over an Indian Burial ground where the Indians buried their mentally insufficient. Because the amount of outright buffoonery at this store... Well, there's no other logical explanation, than the mentally insufficient spirits of Indians coming to inhabitate the bodies of the workers....
A few weeks ago I went to this store around 10:45 pm.... Wanting to get a late night snack after being out with friends. I approached the drive thru window and immediately I get ' yo.... Systems down, man ' .... At first, I thought maybe the speaker system had inadvertently picked up the radio transmission from the hotel across the street where someone was watching a Sci Fi movie and Marlon Wayans was telling some astronaut about their control panel going haywire... ' Yo, systems down, man '. But alas, this wasn't the case. As I came back with ' what? ' . ' yo, systems down man ' . Either the intercepted radio transmission was on a loop or the person manning the speaker thought I could interpret what this meant.... At Mcdonalds.... Maybe if I pulled into the NASA drive thru, I would know what this means, but at McDonalds? Nope. So, I inquired ' so what does that mean ' . I waited.... Then got shouted at by the man in the speaker ' yo man. It means we closed '. This was shocking, as when most businesses close, they turn off lights, have no customers in the store, the drive thru lights are off... This time though all the lights were on,,,, customers milling about inside the store.... Drive thru station lights were on, menu was lit up, no sign was placed on the speakers, to say ' yo.... Systems down, man... or woman - not to be gender specific ' .... But no.... I had the sneaking suspicion this was code for ' yo, we don't wanna work, man, so we came up with this convenient excuse ' ..... You might be saying to yourself ' wow, that's a mighty big leap in judgment ' .... It is, however, it's grounded in some basis of fact. As my mother has told me a tale of recently going there and being told their entire circuit board was down.... First, why does McDonalds use a circuit board? Secondly, the biggest fast food company in the WORLD has the absolute worst electronics? I mean, where did you guys get your systems from?! ' Eddie's Electronic & Sub Shop ' located in some shanty in between 3rd and 4th avenue?!
Also unacceptable things at this store
- It seems like everytime I go to this store I get a drive thru speaker who can't speak conversation English. I'm not asking for someone to enunciate properly or someone to speak in The Kings English. Just someone I can understand what they're trying to say to me.... That's all I ask.... It seems like a daily meeting is called and the manager goes ' ok, who here communicates in the least intelligible speech?! ' someone raises their hand ' ok. Good, you do the drive thru speaker ' Logic people.logic....
- Sometimes when I pull around to pick up my food, and the person opens the drive thru door to hand me it, a rush of flies will come out and fly around my car, then off into the distance.... This is unsettling.... Shouldn't this be the other way around?! I mean if flies are flying away from the food, it sorta speaks volumes....
- The smell.... There's something weird about the smell inside and outside the store that permeates the air... I can't put my finger on it. My mom swears theres a sewer line that bust somewhere close by... I just tell her that's the smell of laziness and despair that emanates from inside the store.... I'm probably not that far off...."
359,"Ordered the Cheetos lovers meal and was given regular pop corn chicken without the Cheetos sauce. Tried calling and no one answered, not surprised."
360,Horrible experience. Nobody was minding the counter and we could hear people arguing and swearing in the back. My son was with me. Unprofessional and unacceptable. Do not support this place. Too many better options in the area.
361,I try not to get negative reviews but I have to this time. Using GrubHub I've attempted to place at least four orders with Lombardi's Pizza and I've only gotten my order once and it was extremely late. I decided to give them a try again today and after two and a half hours I called GrubHub and they called Lombardi's Pizza and was told that they couldn't complete my order. I will never order with them again and I advise you guys to do the same
362,"No surprise hands down the slowest most pathetic place on the face of the planet... the morons at work here are lucky if they can count their fingers and toes. Slower than molasses in winter time I really can't think of anything else to comprehend the total inability to have the ability to work. They want $15 an hour you must be joking me ,  I wouldn't pay them $2 for the speed that they're working at. Other than that were in dire need of subsidence this place is a pathetic joke the manager should be fired the employees should be strung up and smacked with a wet whip... absolutely no care in the world for anybody other than themselves why do they work here get a job at Walmart you could probably get by better but don't leave us out here hanging hungry in the middle of the night I can cook a burger faster on my car hood... obviously extremely distraught this place is going to end me."
363,"These folks have not a clue how to manage a place of business!  Beware and believe all the bad reviews!  Stay away from this place so they, like many other poorly run LJSs, can go out of business!  I will never return!

One star is a gross under statement.....-5 is more appropriate!"
364,if you want popeyes then go to your murfreesboro road location or gallation road location you will get treated fairly and tell them  that mark sullivant sent you
365,"Absolutely disgusting. I will NEVER order from here again. If I could put negative stars I would! I couldn't even eat my food. 
I ordered through Uber Eats. Pictured above is the ""Brown Stewed Red Snapper"". My fish was NOT CLEANED AT ALL! all the innards were still in tack. Also The fish smelled and tasted VERY fishy. Along with that, the brown stew tasted like a thick barbecue sauce. I called the restaurant to complain, however they were closed."
366,"NASTY! I went in here to use the bathroom today, and saw a worker go in at the same time,   then leave without washing her hands! The  
When I told the manager, he was very rude, and wouldn't even come speak to me at first, then gave me a ""so what"" look. This is the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in a restaurant. Don't eat here!@"
367,"bad business. To young and unorganized. they didn't give us our food on time and they had attitudes when we questioned them. They told us 20 minutes that turned into 45 . food still not ready and i spent 41 dollars. They wouldn't give a refund they told me to call my bank.
Unprofessional, why are they still open."
368,"I talked with management today, and was told the Long John Silver's side of this KFC/LJS combo is permanently closed."
369,"This is my 3rd time coming here and this location is always filthy and always unorganized.. The men In the back doesn't listen to anything the female manager tells him to do. She asked him TWICE to drop chicken and every time they ask him has he done it yet he just kept saying ""naw...not yet"" like really dude what the f*ck else could you be doing, because from the looks of things you aren't doing SH*T!!!! We've already been standing there for 10 minutes before the young lady says I'll be with you in a minute and then she disappears. So we are STILL wating to place an order, after 10 more minutes past...we left. The floor was sticky as hell and people were waiting for their order that was there before we came in. CHURCH'S CHICKEN..PLEASE GET YAWL SH*T TOGETHER!!! Of course I won't be back because that's just ridiculous"
370,"We were in the airport early in the morning and trying to decide what to grab for breakfast before boarding our plane.  We decided on Popeye's so we could enjoy a chicken biscuit.  Unfortunately, the service from the cashier was very slow and when we finally got to place our order, she wasn't very friendly to deal with.  

The chicken biscuit was nasty!  The biscuit was stale, hard and fell apart when biting into it.  It lacked flavor too.  The chicken on it was just a couple of their chicken strips and weren't very flavorful.

The hashbrowns were cold.  The coffee was too light and seemed watered down.

We ended up tossing out our food to prevent getting a tummy ache - YUK!"
371,"The food is served room temperature. Bleh. Imagine your excitement to eat, only to be crushed by reality.  Only good thing is you can order items separate and not have to pay for the full meal."
372,"Pretty much the worst Wendy's I've ever gone to. I went to the drive thru after work one day and I got blocked in. I realize that they can help them but they could have told the woman that was at the window who decided to get on her cell phone and talk for 20 minutes to move so that other people could order. But no they let her stay there. Of course I would have driven away and left but I was so stuck between them and the person behind me. I honked  a bunch of times but it didn't hurt either of them or rouse any interest from the person inside. I'm not kidding 20 minutes later after the woman that was dangling her legs out of her own driver side door on the phone made her order I still did not have the right order. So the inconsiderate idiot only went around the corner and got her food, I had to go up and order, by that time I was pretty angry irritated and hungry I told her what I wanted. The cheeseburger deal the $4 one. So she mumbles how much it is it doesn't come up on the screen and I go round the corner to pay her and she tells me its like 9 something. Like an idiot I pay and take it and go and park. Its some crazy quarter pounder. I ate the lettuce and the tomato and maybe a couple bites of meat and bread. I threw the rest away. It was a dry mess! 

Went in another time and just ordered hot tea. The woman had no idea they served hot tea and asked me what it was and then how to make it... and what it looked like. Never ever again."
373,"Don't go here unless you like burned dried up pizza.  No joke, 9 out of 10 times they serve you burnt cardboard.  I called and complained to the manager months ago but nothing changed.  So one time I had them go through all the pizzas looking for one that wasn't quite as burnt.  I asked why they cook them like that and was told that's how the person that cooks them likes his pizza. Sorry but that's ridiculous. I will drive out of my way from now on to go to a different location."
374,Place is gone closed kaput. No longer there no more  closed gone.  I need to write more yelp says.  I wanted chicken and for Greek instead.
375,"""Won't make an exception to use credit cards for orders under $15 no matter how frequently you go there. Bad business will not return."""
376,Horrible if you order delivery expect it to be cold and to get attitude from the driver who delivers the pizza and not one not twice but every Dam time I ordered delivery it's has been horrible and corporate is no better sent them a email and no response I will never go back and spend another cent there run far away before calling this place now domino's up the street didn't much care for them but called for delivery and was surprised pizza was really good and it was hot driver's were pleasant that's where I rather spend my money
377,Horrible service order is never right and they're always out of something. Constantly being told to hold on in the Drive-Thru when you're the only person in the drive thru and you're sitting there for 5 10 minutes
378,"This is the second time I've had a horrible experience here. The workers are rude and unfriendly. They take your money and then tell you that there is a 15 min wait. Why not tell us that before and suggest something else? We asked them this today and the worker said ""yep"" and slammed the window in our face. That was terribly rude and the owner needs to fix it here because apparently I'm not the only one."
379,"Last time.  Never again.  Ordered chicken breast and a thigh.  Got a breast and a wing.  I'm sure I got charged for a thigh.   Overcooked and crust was burnt.  Customer service - apathetic.
Look it up."
380,"Do yourself a favor and do NOT eat here. If you dont want to take my word for it, walk inside. You will wait 45 mins for your food. You will be surrounded by trashed, sticky table. Peeling wall paper. Sticky counters and stools. The fountain soda machine is sticky and covered in slime. After losing your appetite no manager will be around to give you refund. Enjoy."
381,"Your expectations lower when you find yourself at a place like this already, but they actually made me wish I got treated that well here.  I went inside because the drive through had a pretty good sized queue (should've turned away at this point). Moving through the line to order was deceptively quick as we spent 20+ minutes after that waiting for the chicken to be moved from the warmer into a box for us.  When order's behind ours were handed out before us, I asked about ours.  The person behind the counter commented to a coworker that he wasn't looking at the electronic order screen because it was confusing.. there was a huge sigh of disbelief from the hungry crowd of customers I was standing with.  We each had to hand back our receipts to get our orders filled from that point.

Somehow we got a bag of food and got home.  Of course, it was wrong.  We called the manager of the store to report the muffed order and he sounded like we were just one of the many he heard from that night.

I can be quoted as saying, ""Never, ever again."""
382,I have been here twice in the last month. Both times the place is not clean. Dirty floors tables not wiped off and sticky. The waitresses take your order and do not listen   They do not bring you what you order and ignore you when you ask for the item we ordered. I should have learned my lesson a couple weeks ago when I had the same experience.
383,"Back in 1992, I used to manage this store.  It was owned by Jack Shettlesworth & another guy.  His first name was Walter and for the life of me, I cannot remember his name.  Back then, we never ran out of items unless it was REALLY close to closing time.  But, since there is new ownership, every time we have gone there in the last 6 years, they are always out of something. There is no consistency as to what they are out of, but it is mostly the popular side items.  Mashed Potatoes, Gravy, Macaroni & Cheese. Never Cole Slaw though.  Their excuse is always ""we have been busy & those items are very popular"".  Really???  Because when I was managing it, we were ALWAYS busy because of the Air Force Base down the street & the strip club across the street & we NEVER ran out of those things. Now,every time we go there, there is usually 1 or 2 customer in the store & MAYBE 2 cars in the driver thru.  How is that busy?  It may be coincidence that we go there after the rush, but then there should always be someone making more of what they have run out of or running low on.   I have complained on the corporate website & never receive a response back.  Like they don't care.  They should just close this location down or fire everyone & bring in new, better trained employees & managers.  Of course, I have seen other restaurants do that & it turns out like the put icing on a poop cake, it's still a poop cake."
384,"The only place with worse service than this is the Steak and Shake in Fairview. 
A V O I D!!!!!!"
385,We order from this jimmy johns frequently I was told this is extra meat .. I also ordered no lettuce as well next time the office says jimmy johns I'll have something else to say
386,"I'm reviewing mostly on their service, or should I say, lack of service. Why do they give you a ""estimated pick up time"" when you place an online order? You get there and wait the double that amount just to get a large plain pizza. Even on a Tuesday night at 9pm, the line can be out the door. The employees lack any training and don't know how to use the register. I asked for garlic sauce and they said they don't sell that, I asked for grated cheese packets and they don't have that either apparently. 

Save yourself the hassle and go across the street to Domino's, they suck with service to, but at least there's no line."
387,"I'm reviewing mostly on their service, or should I say, lack of service. Why do they give you a ""estimated pick up time"" when you place an online order? You get there and wait the double that amount just to get a large plain pizza. Even on a Tuesday night at 9pm, the line can be out the door. The employees lack any training and don't know how to use the register. I asked for garlic sauce and they said they don't sell that, I asked for grated cheese packets and they don't have that either apparently. 

Save yourself the hassle and go across the street to Domino's, they suck with service to, but at least there's no line."
388,Worst customer service ever. Rather go somewhere eles next time never again will order from this place . Called and order a pizza for pick up got there then they said I never called so I showed them my recent call list and they seem surprise like I was lying or somthing .so then had to sit there and wait another 20 min while my kids was starving . This Pizza Hut sucks !!!!
389,"The most incompetent, unprofessional, ill equipped, worst food service restaurant I have ever had the displeasure of visiting. The whole team needs to be overhauled. I wouldn't spend 1 red cent in here ever again."
390,I live exactly a 5 min walk from this location and it took them 1 hr and 30 mins to deliver my food. And as I called the store they kept hanging up or putting me on hold soon as I called. This has to be the worst location
391,"They messed up our order and gave us burgers with nothing but the meat and the bun, my husbands shake was lacking in the mix ins and my shake had much too many. I prefer the steak n shake in o fallon much more. It is farther away but well worth the drive"
392,This is the worst steak and shake I have ever eaten at. We thought maybe the first time we went it was just a bad night. But no. We waited 10 minutes just for someone to take our drink order. And ended up leaving and going somewhere else.
393,"The only thing good about this place is that you can get drive-through pizza. With that said, I've been waiting here in my car for pizza for 15 minutes now. It's 6 PM on a Monday. No reason not to have pizza ready."
394,"The absolute worst Steak and Shake I have ever been in my life. I would rather travel all the way to Fairview Heights to get Steak and Shake then to ever go to this location again! I literally waited in line for 48 minutes because I had already paid for my food. I was in the Drive-Thru and it took them 48 minutes to even start handing me my food. Everybody behind me in line left. The woman Inside the window went over my order before giving it to me and even though I told her I did not order a chili 5 way the first thing she handed me in the bag was a chili 5 way. I told her it was completely wrong and gave it back. After that wait they told me that the milkshake I ordered was unavailable and asked if I wanted a different kind but never offered to give me back my money. They then gave me two cups of chili instead of two bowls of chili which are twice the price. I paid for two bowls and they tried to rip me off by giving me two cups. My burger that I ordered plain had everything on it so I had to send that back as well. Finally I just pulled my car into a parking space and went inside. I took my food and calmly went inside and told them that I wanted to speak to a manager. after another six minutes the manager finally sauntered out of the back with a dirty shirt licking her fingers as if she just got off for lunch break. She asked me what the issue is and I told her my entire order is wrong and I've been waiting for 48 minutes outside in the Drive-Thru. She looked at me and yelled ""48 minutes?!?  Nu uhh sugar no way."". She literally had to turn around and check the timer to see that I wasn't lying. I finally got my food after making sure they hadn't spit in it first and made my way to work. I got there at 5 and didn't leave until 5:58. Worst experience ever. Everytime I go there it's bad but this was the worst experience I had. No other location is this awful."
395,This is what happens when you only have three people working at 12:30.  The chicken was not ready and the service was horrible   We ended up going to churches down the street.
396,"REALLY KFC??? I  usually drive to 38th Street for grilled chicken from KFC but was driving past and thought I  would give it a try.HUGE  mistake! Drive-thru was packed so I go in. Waited for someone to AT LEAST acknowledge me but after waiting and watching and  employee slurping down his drink staring at me at least 2 minutes I decided Boston Market would be a better choice! ! As I was leaving an employee was coming into the restaurant--- maybe from a smoke break, asked if I had been help.  After telling him NO he offered to help me but I declined and went across the street to Boston Market!!"
397,"Recently I found out that my workplace was within the delivery area of a jimmy johns. Last Friday a coworker and I placed an order for a roast beef sub and a roast beef club. The order arrived right on time, kudos to the driver there. The sandwiches were correct and tasted awesome.
However, four hours later I was at home and the stomach cramps started. The next hour was spent on the toilet, with many return trips to follow. Later that night I texted my co worker to find that he was suffering a similar fate. This lasted all weekend, on and off for both of us. So if you're looking to lose a few pounds real quick, I highly recommend the Pinellas park jimmy johns. Otherwise keep looking."
398,"If I owned this business, I would be firing everyone that works there, including my manager.  First and foremost, every time I go there, they are out of something!!  EVERY TIME!!!  You are a chicken joint, for you to NOT have any chicken product you sell on a regular basis is an absolute joke.  

This might have something to do with the fact that, although the restaurant closes at 10pm, the employees are ready to go with chairs up and sign off at 8pm.  Either you are too lazy to fire the deep frier up, since you shut it down two hours early, or whoever does your ordering is incompetent.  Needless to say, I live a mile from you, but I drive six miles to the next closest KFC just to avoid the bad news that you don't have whatever I order available, consistently."
399,"This is close to where I live so wanted to try it.  DONT GO THERE!  It's old, dirty, the floors are sticky and after standing there for 10 minutes being ignored by staff a girl comes out and takes someone before us!  Very rude and unprofessional and a dump"
400,"Just 1 star because they had chicken a couple times, but didn't have any chicken (only sliders) on my last, very last, visit. Say what!? Yup, a chicken place with no chicken and actually out of mash potatoes too. I believe the food went to the people there (notice I didn't say working). Lets just say they must have run out of Doritos and needed something else to suppress their appetite. Never again to this location."
401,"I came in at 7:30 pm on a Wednesday evening. Chairs were up so I checked the door to make sure they were open. Open till 9:30, awesome!

Walked in and finished up a phone call (close to the front door as I didn't want any employees waiting on me.

I walked up to the counter and the employee was on the phone, talking to a manger (I assume) about their bread count. Her back was to me. She noticed me but did not make eye contact and continued her call. Then she walked to the back, still on the phone.

After standing there for two or three minutes, I noticed another girl also in the back, scrolling through Facebook and eating. She noticed me but did not acknowledge me. 

So I left. The subway up the road on gallatin isn't much better."
402,"This place is the worst. I'm talking like literally ever. I downloaded the yelp app just to leave this review. After I am done I will uninstall the app and never leave another review. They just told me, at 11pm, that they don't sell shakes after 1030 and I just watched them, through the drive through window, give 4 shakes to customers. Then they proceeded to say the don't have any chili either. I have been waiting in the drive through line for over 25 min and there was only one car in front of me. Please do yourself a favor and never come to this establishment​. Thank you for your time and have a good day/evening."
403,The worst service ever. Came with my wife and daughter to get 3 milkshakes and some fries. They screwed it up. Forgot the fries. How can you forget the fries in such a simple order. Have been here 4 times because its close to home and 3 out 4 times have sucked. Don't waste your time. It doesn't even deserve 1 star.
404,"Worst experience-went thru drive through, they messed up my boyfriends order, we returned a minute later to the drive thru-the two employees there were very rude, did not apologize for their mistake, when we said to forget about it; because it was too much of a hassle and we were done dealing with these rude girls, the manager came over and started screaming ""is this what I came over here for?!"" And then kept going going off. I then said ""wow, and this is customer service? You're a manager and you're screaming at me because we had to come back since Our order was incorrect?"" And then she threatened to kick my butt, her and her two incompetent employees started running outside to the parking lot with the intention of wanting to fight me while my boyfriend witnessed everything. I could not believe this was Happening. Our first time visiting St Louis and experiencing this? That woman and her two employees should not be working with the public. I will never return to another Churchs Chicken."
405,Everytime i run here to get so quick dinner for my family of 6 i always end up missing something. Its very frustrating to tripple check the bags and drive home and something is missing. Last tiime was a milkshake this time was all the toys for the children. Im done going here. They wont be getting my money anymore.
406,Worst McDonalds I have ever been to! For the last 5 years I've tried repeatedly to give them another chance. And every chance I give I am sadly disappointed! The wait is almost always 10 minutes minimum even when you're the only customer in drive thru. 9/10 times they mess up the order and then you wait even longer! The staff is not friendly and acts like they have no idea what is going on. Bottom line do not go here! If you want McDonald's drive a few extra minutes to another location for better quality service!
407,"My brother and I go to this location once in a while, and it seems like EVERY time we go to this location they NEVER have pizzas ready. I thought the point of ""Hot and Ready"" was for them to be available upon order with the exception of a busy weekend night and they are trying to keep up. We went tonight and as usual the cheese pizza was not ready. We were told to park up front as usual and were told in 5 mins or less they would bring our order to the car. We waited and waited ( they were not busy) finally after about 15 mins and seeing three cars drive off with pizza, my brother went in to check the status of our order. OUR ORDER HAD BEEN READY JUST SITTING THERE!! . I am calling the manager tomorrow, this ALWAYS happens to us and it seems judging from the comments below it happens often."
408,"Tried this location since my previous one has been shut down. Went on a Tuesday evening, and they were out of half the stuff I wanted to order. They ran out of something else the guy in front of me ordered because someone at the window got the last of it instead. Then they ran out of one more thing I intended to order just before I got to the counter. I never even got any food. Employees obviously must withstand angry customers often, and don't seem to want to be there as indicated by their rudeness. The place was a dirty dump and parking is ridiculous. They didn't even bother to turn on their sign. Two other angry customers stomped out of the store cursing before I could even get to the counter, and one of them warned me about the terrible service and lack of food before they announced that they were out of chicken strips. He promptly left. I will never go to this store again, and I'm glad I never got any food from there. I would not have expected it to be good or even cooked properly. it seems like KFC on the whole (at least in Tucson) is far below what it used to be. Their prices are much higher and the size/quality of the food has decreased dramatically. If I want good fast food fried chicken in Tucson, I'll stick with Lucky Wishbone, Church's or Popeyes. Sad because KFC used to be the best. Totally at the bottom now."
409,"This is probably the worst of all the KFC locations. They are always out of product and I'm not even talking late at night before closing either. I tried to purchase their chicken pot pie at 12 noon on a Sunday and was told they were out.
Another occasion they had those little mini commercials on constantly so I decided to go and purchase a few. But upon ordering during a Sunday afternoon they were out of the buns for the mini's. can't see how this place stays in business."
410,"One star is not even worthy here had to put something, time after time they can't get the order correct or even give the correct change, always out of something, common sense, customer service and quality is in the toilet here, mind you this is based on multiplue visits, GOING TO STICK WITH CHURCHES UP THE STREET WHERE THE FOOD AND SERVICE HAS PROVEN TO BE LEAGUES ABOVE THIS KFC."
411,"Not that I expect much out of KFC to begin with,  but this location has been nothing but issues the only two times I've attempted to eat there.  One day, on a Tuesday,  I went there at 7pm and they were closed even though their sign says they close at 10. Today when I went,  I pulled up to the drive through and a woman came on the intercom and stated they were no longer accepting drive thru orders and I would need to come inside."
412,"Never did receive that refund, but that is okay. We ate the awful food because we were hungry but have not gone back to any Jimmy John's. This experience left a bitter taste in our mouths, literally and figuratively."
413,THIS PLACE IS GROSS!!!! Oh my gosh it needs to be shut down and cleansed!! It doesn't even deserve the one star! I walked in looked around saw how gross it was and walked out!
414,"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE AND FOOD EVER!
I have given this Subway numerous chances and they fail every time. Raj, whom I believe is the owner/manger, is rude and unfriendly. Actually, everyone that works there is unfriendly with the exception of a younger girl that is always smiling and says hello. Raj was a complete jerk when they messed up my sandwich and I called him on it. They when I went back for a replacement sandwich he was even more rude. I will NEVER go to this subway again. The plus side is that Tower Deli just opened up near Douglas and the food, service, and prices and OUTSTANDING!"
415,"So we went in at 9:00 and it is now 10 and our order has just been taken. There's not that many people in the restaurant and we had to seat ourselves. They got my drink order wrong, which I didn't know was possible, and instead of seating people, the hostess/server was just standing around in the back, with a non uniform jacket on. When she finally seated them, the were right next to us, she she had very bad customer service. You know it's bad when the customers get up and seat other people to try to help"
416,I came in eat but had to use the restroom they were locked the 2 ladies told me in order to use the restroom I had to order something to eat needless to say it ruined my appetite so I ordered a drink and cookies the lady went on to say that's the only way you can use our public restrooms I advised her that was very strange
417,"My husband went through the drive thru to order some food for our family. The food we recieved was barely edible. I couldn't eat the meal he got for me it looked disgusting, dried up and old. He brought me the food to my work. I looked at it and immediately was disgusted. I call ed d anf spoke to Kaylee the manager about the disatisfaction in the food, which she agreed I could bring it back and ask for her. When I got she greeted me J showed her the food and she said she didnt see nothing wrong with it, but that she would make me a fresh one. I told he I just wanted my money back, ( after looking at how gross and unclean the environment was).  She the stated that she didnt even charge my husband for the meal so she would not be able to refund it, and that they did not give refunds anyways. I told her that was unacceptable and I would not be leaving without a refund. She went to another employee who was working on a computer and gave him my order and receipt, he asked me what the problem was. I told him to just look at it, the sandwich looked old, he then broke it apart to show me it wasn't old. I told him I didnt care what the inside looked like the outside looked disgusting and I came all the way from my place of work on my lunch break to get my money back. He had an attitude and finally after 5min of arguing with them, they refunded my 7.52 cents. Pathetic customer service, disgusting environment and gross food. Will never eat there again in my life."
418,"THIS IS LITERALLY THE WORST MCDONALDS EVER!!!! Each and every time I decide to order from here they mess up on EVERYTHING!!!!! You ask for fresh fries they'll give you the opposite! You request ""no pickles"" they'll put extra! Always under staff and workers are always rude! This store should be shut done"
419,Stop in place my order informed it would be 10 minutes. OK no problem I step outside to make a phone call. While on the phone outside I'm looking in at the kitchen and notice the female cook drop meat on the floor... look around...... YES...... she threw the meat in the WOK.......Ok I put my call on hold to let the man at the counter know I saw from outside the window... They begin to yell at each other in their language....but she never denied it... I've heard other horror stories but this one I saw with my own two eyes........ Never again....... Stay Away
420,"Decided to attempt to eat here again via the drive-thru. Very stupid decision. The third time I got blocked in with somebody in front of me just sitting there for about 15 minutes. Yes I got extraordinarily angry as this is now the third time that this has happened. I can't say for sure if it was the person in front of me's fault or the restaurant but the blame is on the restaurant because they could have told the person to move forward. They simply don't care. They never have coffee they don't understand what hot tea is, and apparently now they don't know how to make a baked potato. This is the worst fast-food restaurant I've been to in the entire world and I've actually been to many countries. This is not a diss on Wendy's in particular it's just this one. I don't like leaving bad reviews but this place is just sad."
421,"Rude rude owners and their children or whomever it is that works there, rude people, sub par food, gave me diarrhea, don't want to deliver. Not even worth one star.  Skip by this place, head a couple miles down Union turn on maple to hing far way better."
422,"Really bad service experience， it says close at 10 but when I go 9:20, it is nothing to sell. Burgers？ No. Wings? No."
423,"Don't do it... the owner does not care who he hires---normally a questionable character from the neighborhood; no, like for real! And the food is never of quality ..want a salad?! Expect lettuce stems. Want chicken fingers or a chicken wrap?  Expect old chicken or raw chicken. The pizza is never the same.. the wing dings come like someone's chewed them up, spit them out and covered them in sauce. Let's not begin talking about ""the Cheesesteak."" You're kinda bullied into going to this spot if you live in the neighborhood because it's one of the only ones here... but I'd rather spend money at the McDonald's up the street than eat here....at least you know what you're getting....sorta. lol"
424,"Daughter ordered the #13. It is supposed to come with 6 pieces of cheese, hers had 3. I ordered a #2 the roast beef was well done, not medium rare. We called the manager and he was going to refund our entire meal. We will see if that happens and I will update my review.

On another note, they also do not deliver to my house, only 1.81 miles away. I timed my drive home and it took me exactly 5 minutes, even stopped at 2 red lights. This is a Jimmy John's problem not this particular franchise's problem."
425,"Overpriced garbage. Salmon and shrimp were over cooked, rice was old and vegetables were hard. Everything was sitting in a huge layer of margarine not butter. It's obvious they use cheap quality products. On top of the poor food, their customer service subpar. Do yourself a favor- don't order here!. If you want shrimp, just go to Sid Bookers."
426,Worst kfc I've ever ate at!!! You can tell they take absolutely no pride in their food!! biscuits were rock hard chicken was very greasy and cold very disgusting!! Do not eat here you will be very disappointed!!
427,"No customer service, no receipt, our orders were messed up. My chicken was old and stale, not fresh and hardly even warm. Mashed potatoes taste like they buy dry mix from the 99 cent store."
428,"If I could give 0, I would.  Arrived.  The manager, a female,  was literally yelling at an employee in front of me.  Neither looked up or stopped their tirade.  Next,  ordered the 4.99 chicken pot pie.  Waited 24 minutes because this is how long it takes for fresh ones.  GO TO Boston Market,  spend the extra 1.30, you will get way more chicken.  My pot pie was cream,  carrots,  and celery.. .maybe corn.  Hardly any chicken.  What a waste.  Next,  no one could tell me the cost of four biscuits.  Someone told me $4.00 for 2...another quoted me 5.89 for 4. Quite literally,  it was a mess.  It's a freaking side,  get it right.  Hire a better store manager,  know your product,  and keep the bs  at home."
429,"Horrible service. Food never showed up. Called two hours later.. said it was coming never did. 40 min later ended up driving there which is a 3 min drive away and they said it was ""delivered"" when we said it wasn't so where is the food they didn't know."
430,We went here after an event and the wait times were TERRRIBBBLLLEEE! The food was WAY too greasy for. I was infuriated!
431,"Screw you KFC. You charge a service fee for using a debit card yet you don't let your customers know!  Seriously, a big company like you and you have to charge me a service fee? Plus, I CALLED the number on the receipt about the discrepancy between the quoted amount and the actual debited amount, but the KFC owner did NOT return my call! It's pretty obvious you don't give a rip about customer service.  And that you are a tightwad."
432,"Horrible. Never once have they got my order correct, cold food, terrible service, they even closed 30 mins before their sign said they close one time. Do not go to this taco hell."
433,"First of all, I normally enjoy Steak n Shake, but the one at 4320 West Main in Belleville needs to get their act together. The past few times I went there, they had the following assorted issues: 

No chili, dining room closed, could not serve food due to the grease needing drained, etc."
434,I ordered a salmon platter earlier this week. The customer service was horrendous and the food was subpar. I won't be patronizing this establishment again. The entire staff needs to learn that your goal is to make the customer want to patronize your establishment again not run the other way!!! #DONTBUYFROMSEAFOODSENSATIONS
435,I'm so disappointed with 69th st pizza!  My pizza was burnt not to mention I ordered 2 large pizzas and they both was burnt! I been ordering from pizza Hut for years and they fell off bad! 69th st location that is. Then the delivery man came to pick up the 2 large boxes of pizza with an attitude! Never again! I'm not even a fan of dominoes but I have to say they are catching up! And I think I'll rather spend my money there!
436,"I have been very ill today , and after picking up my medications decided to drive across the street to grab a quick bite to eat. It's raining pretty hard up here currently so it's hard to hear. I placed my order and drove up to the window. I was asked if I had "" little chickens"" I ordered popcorn chicken and thought she was referring to that by a different name. I paid, she started handing me drinks, where I realized this wasn't my order. I told her and she yelled "" I JUST ASKED YOU IF YOU HAD CHICKEN SANDWICHES"" and then slammed the window in my face. Another guy tried to correct my order and I just asked for my money back. Meanwhile, Tasha is her name, kept walking by the drive thru window laughing. I was beyond mad and baffled . How a place is still open after their employees treat the customers like crap is beyond me. My money is better else spent somewhere else. Never coming to this location"
437,This place is the worst on two occasions I didn't even get my order when I called they hung up on me. One time the sauce was rotten it hurt our tongue just a taste it they said they would give me and full refund never got it. I'll never order from here again
438,"How do they run out of something everytime we go there? This time it was chicken, macaroni, green beans and pepsi. After taking my money and order, We had to pull forward, also after waiting 10 min at the drive through window. Then at least FIVE people pulled forward and left while we were parked. I went in to get my food and they still hadn't put ours together. They acted like we were such an inconvenience But sending buckets out the window. wth is wrong with these guys? They also forgot my food in our bag after insisting that everything was in there. I freaking hate KFC now."
439,Saw that they were open until midnight. Pulled up to get a quick meal and sat at the drive thru for almost 5 minutes waiting on someone to greet me. I had to call the restaurant to get a response. Finally I was told that they were closed for cleaning. There were no signs posted saying they were closed.
440,"Zero stars. Gave order, paid the guy, waited 5 minutes. Then told NO WHITE MEAT‼ WTF‼‼ Out of cole slaw. What are they doing all day? Watch out for the HUMONGOUS pothole as you enter. We walked out with cash in hand, not waiting 20 minutes!"
441,"I ordered a bucket of chicken, original all dark.What I got was about six pieces dark.And the rest were white extra crispy. 12 piece bucket. The corn was dry and tasted like it had been sitting out all day.I will never go back to KFC.Called and asked for the Mgr. And found out Marcellis is not the Mgr of this store.He was flippant. I'm recommending to my friends not eat at KFC.Unless you want your order wrong and the food substandard."
442,"the guy taking my order was either an idiot or completely untrained, I'll go with untrained. he couldn't find the mcpick 2 on the computer cash register. this went on for about 5 minute. he asked for help and was ignored. I became frustrated and left and went to burger king. this isn't the first time i have had problems here. last time I waited 20 minutes for my order, and it wasn't even right. unfortunately this is the closest place from my house."
443,"Terrible.  Sometimes when at the airport in airside F I will go here.  Every time I say never again.  This time I mean it.  It is expensive for a greasy breast and two wings with a little biscuit and side.    Red beans and rice was a half cup of pureed bean mush and lousy rice.  Greasy chicken.  Ugh.  Just go to the Chilis next door.  A couple bucks more for much more, better, and potentially healthier food."
444,Ordered food at 615 PM at 7:30pm called they said it just came up I will get in 15-20min. Called back at 8:15 no answer. So I will never order from them again
445,Place is bad. Food is very eh and staff is very rude. Will never buy food from them again and thats a promise.
446,"Do not ever go this Wendy's avoid it go down the road 20 minutes and get it somewhere else you will still get home quicker slowest Wendy's I've ever seen. Dumb employees who don't listen don't look up don't pay attention wait in line 20 minutes and get your order wrong. Avoid at all costs. 

Franchise owner needs to step yo and improve his staffing or Wendy's should take his or her franchise away"
447,I can't wait for the day they replace human error and ignorance with machines that get your order right. Planned on treating myself with a $9 baconator meal but it was more like a dollar menu item and just one big waste of money.
448,This is absolutly the worst place I uave ever been to. It should be shut down. Their have been times when the employees were locked out cause their wasn't anyone to let them in. The food is bad and I have had blood in my chicken. Ill order food pay for it and only get half sometimes. I have waited half an hour just for a famous bowl. And it still hasnt changed.
449,"Agree with other Yelpers. 
Really bad chicken, dirty and small dining area.
Someone actually walked out and quit while we were there. Manager was nice and apologetic to customers, but don't bother coming here, just bad."
450,"This was the worst KFC I have ever had. Chicken was dry, and disgusting. Went back and asked for a refund. The manager was rude, and refused. I will never go to this run down KFC ever again."
451,"Id like to give this a NO STAR rating.  We have enjoyed KFC for years.  The food has generally been very good.  This trip to KFC was a different location than our usual.  The experience was also very different.  The chicken; regular, all white, 8 piece was unedible.  My husband ate 1/2 piece and I ate 1 bite.  The breading was soft, the chicken had a green tint.  We looked through the chicken and could not really identify what the pieces were.  There was some pretty gross stuff under the breading and it was all green-looking.  The potatoes and gravy were awful, biscuits hard, corn cold and old-looking.  All of it went into the trash.  I communicated this experience to KFC on line.  I have heard nothing back.  I do hope this is addressed by the company."
452,"I don't usually get chicken an if I do it's usually from the grocery stores. But today my gf said she just had to have a KFC famous bowl so of course being the good man I am I come to the nearest location. After waiting in the drive thru in 102 degree weather an still no one has came on the intercom to take my order, I drive around to the window still nobody, I drive around to the door an 2 of the 3 workers are outside smoking. I go inside an make sure they know how long I was waiting. The worker just says it's not his fault they don't have enough staff so they can't work the drive thru. I order my food an they guy proceeds to throw the bowls around like a child would to let you know he is mad. If this place doesn't get better management I will definitely DEFINITELY not be coming here again. Wish I could give less stars!"
453,Worst drive thru service.  Immature idiots running it so I left without placing an order.  Scared to what they will do to your food so I will never return.
454,I would love it if the drive through person would stop calling my wife cute and asking her irrelevant questions to his job description that makes her uncomfortable. You don't talk to and treat customers that way too unprofessional. Wendy's needs to do a better job setting expectations and monitoring their employees. This just happened tonight 12/22/16 around 10:20pm
455,"Filthy!!!  Windows were so dirty you could not see through them!  Same thing with inside.
I walked out.
Gross"
456,Just horrible service in general.  Management doesn't give a crap. They were out of horrors shells. Then said they did it have nacho cheese ready. No good when you have had drinks at the ballgame and need a late snack.
457,"This is the WORST McDonalds I've ever eaten at, and it's only a mile away from my house. They routinely put pepper on their hamburgers but don't warn you - YUCK! And they CHARGE now for adding mayo, but don't give you a break for keeping the lettuce or pickles.

They told me their Peppermint Mochas can be made in sugarfree, then the person making it told me no, only vanilla and caramel are in sugarfree.  THE WORST THING?  When I told her I am diabetic, she actually told me it ""will be ok, my aunt is diabetic and she drinks them all the time.""  CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?  She could kill somebody!"
458,"This Wendy's location has been on a downward spiral.  It takes longer and longer to get your order and it is never correct.  The workers are rude and are more concerned about socializing than customer service.  This was the last time we will be back with this experience.  We starting  going into the restaurant for take out as the drive through takes forever and the order are guaranteed to be wrong.   The order placed today from start to finish with no other customers in the restaurant it took 19 minutes, the order was wrong as always, and the quality of the food was horrible.  The large fries were half filled, cold and stale.  The burger patties were cold and stale, the cheese was not even melted.  The side salad was half full. There were no choices of light dressings as there are at other Wendy's. The Dr. Pepper was poured as Diet Coke.  There are multiple fast food in the vicinity of Wendy's.  We will not be back and its a shame as we used to be big fans."
459,"Finally, there's a Jimmy John's near me!!! But, much to my surprise, I'm not in their delivery area. I live 2.2 miles from the new location on 34th St. N. in Pinellas Park, FL. So disappointing. So, if I have to drive there to get a sandwich, I might as well go to Jersey Mike's. As much as I love Jimmy John's, I do prefer Jersey Mike's. Sure wish they delivered!!!"
460,"This place was so dirty that I went and ate in my car because I felt unsanitary eating at one of their tables.  My visit started with a bathroom break and hand wash.  The urinal had several dry boogers above it to look at as you went.  The floor was covered in pee.  Trash can overflowing.  The fountain area had all the lids in the bags still as I guess the restaurant was too lazy to put them in their proper holders.  There were no napkins in the lobby at all.  They had paper towels from the bathroom for napkins.  Almost every table at this place was dirty, even though they weren't very busy.  The man who took my order was very friendly and did redeem the place enough for me to actually eat the food.  But, that being said, my pizza (this was a Pizza Hut/taco bell combo store) was kinda cold, the sauce for the breadsticks was lukewarm.  Breadsticks were decent, good amount of seasoning and fresh.  All around though a terrible experience though.  Probably won't be back."
461,"In the 15 years I've lived in tucson,  I've eaten at this kfc on numerous occasions,  and every single time I am reminded how shitty this kfc is.  Always out of a side of some sort,  this time being mac and cheese.  It has always been something every time,  and I go 6 months to a year end decide to give it another go,  and this time is the last time.  I will never go back.  At least to that location"
462,"Ordered online workers complaining how busy they were , order promised to be ready at 103 and still waiting 15 min later still waiting . While another customer complaining staff was telling her they were too busy. They were experiencing technical difficulties however service was very slow"
463,"In total we waited 32 minutes for cold chicken. Adonis (name on receipt) was rude when taking our order and then made sure to swipe my card before telling me I needed to pull up for ""four minutes"" while my chicken cooked. Over 15 minutes went by before I ended up just going into the store. Our order was sitting on the counter, and the ""server"" at the register was annoyed that I even bothered coming in. Never again at this location."
464,"Wish I could give zero stars. Manager seated us thats as far as it got. We sat there for 10 min and no one came to our table as the servers in back were arguing who was ""working like a slave""."
465,"If I could give it a zero stars I would... I usually don't go to this location but since it was near school, thought I would give it a chance. Ordered the famous bowl fill up, had to wait for the popcorn chicken. After I got my food, headed back to school, once I opened up the bowl.... there was only about 1/4 of food in there. Probably 4 pieces of chicken, almost no corn or cheese. I now see why people don't recommend this location."
466,"Wish i would have yelped before going to this place. Most poorly ran restaurant i have ever been. Waited 10 min for waitress.  Should of known then. Btw, we were one of 5, yes FIVE, occupied tables lol. Waitress walks up. Can i start you off with drinks or maybe any kind of typical greet??  Nope. ""Know what you want?""  I looked at the wife and thought, here we go. Ordered. Estimate 10 minutes before our drinks got to us.  35,yes 35minutes later our food arrived.  Waitress told us they had a new person on the grill. Hmmmm, seems like they are fitting right in.  Burgers were good, I must say. But the fries looked and tasted refried.  Not dirty oil like others on here have said. Luke warm but saturated in grease. Waitress or cook forgot- mayo on side, onions, chili sauce, crackers, parm cheese. Drink refills??  Lol. You know that answer.  Never again.  Went to pay and cooking area was TRASHED.  Burger(s),buns, fries, burger condiments scattered everywhere.  The ""new"" cook leaning on/holding the counter up. Annnnd, there was 6 ppl working. 14 patrons, 6 employees.  Table behind us for about 15 minutes still had no drinks when we left. Told them good luck. Real shame when employees ruin the potential of businesses. I blame all this on the chili 3 way, damn the crave!!  Wife is currently trying to contact 1-800 #, on hold for 11 minutes now. Prolly the other 4 tables blowing it up."
467,I have to agree with the rest of the reviews.  Wow.  20 minutes to get our food....order was wrong...no apology.  Won't be back to this one.
468,"Arrived at 1145pm and sat in drive through, only one car in front of us. Got to the order speaker at around 1150pm and sat there waiting to order. At 1202am we were informed that their system had shut down at midnight and it would take 20mins to reboot. We pointed out that we had been waiting at the speaker for ten minutes before midnight to order. The manager said they were busy with the other customer's order. It was ONE car and they ordered ONE single sandwich. There was plenty of time for them to at least take our order before midnight and before their system shut down. Her solution was to go park in the parking lot for another 20 mins and then drive back around. We're going to another Steak n Shake. This one is always horrible and the manager was rude."
469,"I went through the drive up and ordered the #14 and when i got home, i realized they gave me the #17 instead. I called the store and finally answered the 3rd time i tried. I had to go back to get the right order. They did replace it but please answer your phone the first time and get it right the time we place the order so we do not have to make several trips."
470,"I know it's a little silly to review a fast food restaurant but this one needed a bashing!  
Have ya ever had a craving for something and when ya finally got it you were totally disappointed?  Well that's what happened to me this evening.
First of all, the darned speaker thing at the drive through was all jacked up so ordering was a pain in the patoot!  So we drive up to the window to find a very animated and friendly fellow.  He may have had our order all wrong and forgot our drinks but at least he was pleasant. He may have been a tad high but really what can you expect.  I certainly don't hold it against a restaurant worker who's been smoking. It goes with the territory.
So we drove home to find nearly in eatable chicken in our bucket!  I use the term Nearly cuz we were starving and ate the entire box, but it was pretty horrid.  The chicken was almost damp.  Instead of crispy, golden brown the chicken was slimy and over cooked.  Kind of black.  It wouldn't have bothered me so much but I had a long day and didn't have the strength to drive back to have the order fixed or to go somewhere else.  I've eaten at this location before and it was ok.  This may have been the last time we hit KFC. 
Lesson learned.  I should've taken a little extra time and searched Yelp to find what nearby place offered the best fried chicken and just gone and gotten myself some wonderful food!  Then I'd be writing a four or five star review of a great new place right now instead of ranting about how bad a chain is!"
471,"I've tried ordering from this place twice in the last two weeks through the pizzahut website. 

1st experience - Order was place for delivery with an estimated time of 40 minutes. Received a call approximately 1 1/2 hrs later and was informed they don't have any delivery drivers.

2nd experience - Order was placed online for delivery. Estimated time was 40 minutes. Received a call about 10 minutes after the order was placed. Again.. was informed there weren't any delivery drivers. 

This is a shame, if you don't have any delivery drivers, you shouldn't have the option for delivery. I officially give up on ordering from pizzahut. I think their competitors PapaJohns and Dominos would appreciate my money."
472,The staff don't believe in washing hands with soap. Went there yesterday around 7:15 I like to wash my hands especially when you're grabbing the doors are coming to the facility. I made a cashier aware of no so she asked me did I want it now or later I said I would like it now. The cashier and a girl working at fries thought it was funny I did not get soap for 15 minutes. Prior to this 15 minute wait there is a large man dressed in black with a brown beard went on break he heard me saying it was no soap in the men's bathroom and he continues to use the bathroom and came out and wipes his hands on his pants by his kneecaps and he is one of the  cooks in there. The manager with the red shirt tall guy with a potbelly put soap in there after 15 minutes and no one said sorry for the inconvenience he is a rude person and so is the rest of the staff.
473,"Horrible. Ordered pizza today and it tastes like cardboard, and could probably have bought better tasting freezer pizza. Never had a complaint before but today was a waste of money"
474,"I can't see this place to hang in business much longer. The left door into the business does not work, hasn't for months but of course putting a sign saying don't use this door is too much trouble. Typically you have to stand around and try and flag somebody down to take your order. Then wait quite awhile because they are typically out of chicken. Today go to use the bathroom and the door is already part way open because it's broken and won't shut all the way. The fluorescent light is just dimly flickering. There was so but there is no way to dry your hands because there's no air dryer or paper towels in the dispenser."
475,"If I could give 0 stars I would. I will NEVER order from this Pizza hut, if any at all again. It is now clear to me why so many locations are closing down. The lack of care that goes into making these pizzas is appalling. Pizza Hut used to be my favorite place to have pizza that is no more of the case this pizza was so sloppily made and of such poor quality that I do not even want my family to eat it. I will be spreading the word. I'm baffled as to how the crust in 3in wide, there's only cheese in the center that's halfway melted but yet the crust on the is almost burnt, unbelievable. I ordered extra pepperoni and they put the normal amount on. Ridiculous!"
476,We've gone to this place for the past 2 nights and they've been closed both times when they were supposed to be open till at least 2am. Ridiculous. Never coming ever again.
477,"Little Caesar good Pizza but worse management, I was there twice havenot got pizza both time, it's kinda bad service, at my first visit I was told they were down on system so cannot take any order and on my second visit they were out of Pizza dough what a fk"
478,"I went here a few days ago, ordered a 4 for $4 with sriracha sauce during a lunch rush. Waited about 25 minutes in line, lady at the window was not polite at all. Having worked at a wendy's for 2 years in the past, I tried making small talk about the rush. She stared at me, handed me my food, and closed the window without saying a word. 
I looked into the bag a few seconds after pulling away and realized they forgot my sauce and straw for my drink. Not a huge deal, it was busy. I went up to the door and knocked- dining room hours were posted 11 am - 2 pm for carry out. It was 12:45 pm. Doors were locked. 
I stood there for a bit, knocking and motioning. A few employees noticed me, but nobody helped me or let me in. So, I got back into my car, and went back through the drive through. I waited through 4 more cars in front of me, pulled up to the speaker, and told her all I needed was my one sriracha sauce they forgot.
The lady just said ""ok"". I asked if someone could run it out to me so I don't have to wait in line, she ignored me. I waited for the 4 other cars to get their food (which took about 25 mins by the way- unacceptable at my Wendy's. When i got to the window; the lady swung open the window, handed me one sauce, and immediately slammed it without saying sorry, thank you, or acknowledging my horrible service and combined wait of 50 minutes for a 4 for $4. Food was cold and unenjoyable. my sundae spilled all in the bag because lid was not secured.  I will never be back to this Wendy's"
479,Bad food bad services dirty floors dirty kitchen area dirty tables ignorant management.  I don't see how this place is still open.  The company needs to fire everyone close for a few days clean it up and start over!!
480,"I just sat in line, behind TWO cars,  for 22 minutes and my fries are stale and cold 
I don't frequent fast food locations very often it's kind of like a treat for me ....First and last time I ever go to this Wendy's"
481,This place is terrible period. If you wanna feel like your inconveniencing them by wanting to place an order then you need to check this place out!! Slow unfriendly service.  I have given this place a couple of tries and I'm done.  There's plenty of other options
482,"Would give this a 0 if possible. Building was not welcoming at all. Arrived at 7:013 , closing is set at 9 and all the tables were set up not allowing to eat in. Never welcomed or asked what I wanted to eat. Very unprofessional employees, blasting inappropriate music. Noticed an employee throwing up what appeared to be gang signs. Definitely going to firehouse subs instead.."
483,"Worst place I have ever been to, food looks nothing like it shows and it taste plain as can be. I asked is this was the right burger and she told me yep that's how they come."
484,"I'm McHating it.

I wanted a chicken sandwich.  I waited twenty minutes and was told the wait was due to the staff not knowing how to make chicken sandwiches.  How does that even happen?  

My order was wrong, twice.  

This place is only for the serious masochist."
485,"This place is awful! They made us wait in line for 10 minutes, and then came to the window and told us they were out of biscuits......  as if this wasn't bad enough, I made a comment on how sad the other drivers in line would be.... to my astonishment the guy leans out the window and says, "" oh they didn't order any, just yal....""  Never again will I put my dinner on the line at this Store.... Good bye 4eva!

P.S. we ordered Grilled chicken and got Original Recipe too... terrible!"
486,Usually get the wrong thing or like this most recent time they only gave me half the things I ordered. Rarely fresh.
487,"Can't fairly write a review as the two times I have stopped by here they closed early. On time standing in front of the register, the staff began trying to talk me out of an order even though they were open for another 10 min.  Clearing poorly managed, with no owner involvement."
488,We came in at 12:50 on a Tuesday afternoon. The place was filthy. No one was in the lobby and every table was dirty and not wiped off. The floor was a mess and the garbage can was sitting out of the housing unit. You can tell the staff was frustrated. The service was quick but it made me wondering if the food was even safe to eat.. I worked at this location over 20 years ago and I definitely feel it has gone down hill. I will never bring my family here again and will seriously suggest keeping away from this location.
489,So true terrible steak n shake hate them dinning room dirty. Floors. Greasy I feel  please close it down
490,"This location obviously needs new management and all new employees. The problem with speed, accuracy, edible food and sanitary conditions have been going on for YEARS. The last time we went to this location, my mother ordered a taco salad and received a head of lettuce with a handful of shredded cheese and barely discernible meat, one large chunk if tomato. My burger was cold and had none of the toppings. Horrible! And a drive through visit takes at least 30 minutes, regardless of the number of patrons."
491,"One day we went to the place on our lunch break walked up to the door. We saw a young lady get up and lock the door.  We couldn't get in and there was no one at the drive thru. Please tell me why you come to work and refuse to serve people. You don't lock potential customers out of the damn establishment. And another thing. I always got sick at this location.  There use to be some cool people working there but now I don't even bother going.  Ever so often I would get this guy at the window who was all super nice. Now, not so much. I'd rather not return."
492,"This place is a toilet.  I've tried them repeatedly, and I've never enjoyed my experience.  

Every time I've ordered food, it takes light years longer than it should, even when I've called in an order or placed it online.  

The food is sub-standard for PH standards, and I don't want anyone else to make the same mistake..."
493,"Mc Donalds in Sun Valley. You can always count on your fries being cold. I finally had it the third time so I asked for hot fries. They told me to pull forward and park by the entrance and theyd bring some out to me. I waited 20 min. Nothing. I pulled forward to get gas watching. They never showed after 30 minutes.
This is a reflection on bad management and employees that do not care in the least. I would skip this place if I were you."
494,"I received a call 45 minutes after my order was placed that one of my orders can not be fulfilled.
The cashier stated they can offer me a soda in place of fries however I don't drink soda i made them aware that i will just like $2.99 back for the fries i paid for already.

The cashier stated i needed to take the fries or i will get nothing And was very rude 

I requested the manager number and was given +1 (215) 730-1301 

I called the manager she stated that she is making deliveries and can not handle anything right now and i will have to wait Till she calls me back and hu on me 

I called corporate filed a complaint 

The manager called back and said no one should have given her number out she was not concerned with the poor customer service that I received at all 

She then asked if I wanted a soda as well or there is nothing she can do .

I explained to her that i do not drink soda she said well she will just cancel my whole order .. hu and i never got my food
THE WORST CUSTOMER CUSTOMER IN THE WORLD I WOULD'VE GIVEN IT 0STARS IF I COULD"
495,"Hi I'm Tony & I'm in the restaurant business with 4 locations. So stop by the Golf Links rd location because the wife love KFC, anyways I waited more than 30 minutes and was next in line, the staff was not trained on a register. Then more people come in and the still can't take an order. Like other reviews the same has been my expieriance, AVOID place this terrible service, dirty & yes they had no chicken on my visit prior to 8/11/19 All the tables,floors,and work stations. They were out of extra crispy. But by that time I was so blown away that I went from KENTUCKY 2 LOISIANA chicken that is. The place is a joke I'd have given less than a 1if I could but it's still the Colonel Recipe. Good luck Thanks for reading"
496,Don't go to this location if you actually want food in a timely fashion or you don't want to be treated badly for wanting your money back after being lied to about wait time. ALWAYS out of chicken
497,Can you give less than 1 star? This KFC is just terrible. If you want KFC drive to a different one. Plus our mac n cheese is crusty
498,Yo This Place is the worst im surprised it aint Shut down yet! The Customer service Sucks i called to place a order the Young had me on hold for 15 minutes i called back the put the Answering machine on saying the store was closed. Mind you this was at 3pm on a friday.  I gave them one more chance amd the little girl yes Little Girl!! Didnt even know who to place a. Order! I dont know how they make money but the people there are Ghetto Ratchet and unprofessional. If i could give them negative stars i would!!
499,"Service at the McDonald's on 72 Clinton St, Trenton, NJ is consistently poor. On my last visit Yvonne the manager gave me such an attitude, trying to take the order of the person behind me rather than taking my order. When she finally decided she'd take my order first, she gave me attitude the whole while then purposefully screwed my order up. How do you scan a coupon from their Mcdonald's app for a BOGO for $0.01 yet only provide one item full price? Well Yvonne scanned the coupon but didn't provide the deal. Worse when I complained she denied making a mistake then referred me to her GM Yvenson. He asked me to see the coupon but their app of course pulled it from the McDonald's app because it was ""used."" Sh*t show all around. I asked for their names and employee numbers and then they were only willing to waive the cost of the $0.01 item. I declined the ""offer"" opting to call in a complaint to their corporate office. Neither Yvonne on Yvenson offered an apology. Unfortunately they're located at Trenton Transit so they'll get business no matter how bad their management was. Steer clear."
500,"what happened to dressing in the uniforms? customer service?
It seems they are more into the drive thru. waited 4 min. (inside) and one person in front of me and 6 behind me. Not one person looked at us or even helped us. I walked out and will never go back. This is not the first time I have walked out because no one wanted to help."
501,"My bad, Didn't read the reviews before I paid this place is lame how can you run out of chicken When that's in the name of the business"
502,The lady that answers the phone is illiterate. Completely got my order wrong and when i called to have them exchange it she told me because I opened it they couldn't send me the correct order. Then proceeded to tell me that she can't make the cooks recook the order. Horrible service. Avoid at all costs.
503,I have never experienced such rudeness. The staff was super unfriendly. Extremely unsanitary.
504,"Terrible service and always out of food.  I went to the drive-thru of KFC around 7:30 PM to order a family bucket, the extra crispy.  As I pulled up a truck in front of me appeared confused and left the drive thru.  It was my turn to order..... I requested the bucket of extra crispy and was told they were completely out.  The guy said it would take 15 minutes for them to cook it, his demeanor sounded upset and annoyed of customers.  I said never mind and drove away the truck behind me heard the employee's reaction also and drove away.  
This honestly hasn't been the first time this KFC has ran out of food during operating hours.  It just upsets me that it has been happening more frequently and the management doesn't seem to care.    I've had better luck going to the KFC on the south side of tucson vs going to the east side."
505,"I AM SO SICK AND TIRED OF THIS WENDYS 
HOW HARD IS IT TO GET MY ORDER RIGHT? 

Every so often I go to this Wendy's and order a 4 for 4 and either these people are deaf, inattentive, or simply don't gaf about their customers 

Wanted to reward myself for passing test and I order a crispy chicken bLT no tomatoes a craving that I have been having since forever and this is what I order EVERYTIME I GO ----- why the hell do I always wind up with burgers, no bacon, and one time even wound up with double nuggets and no sandwich.  Out of 10 times I have given them chances they have only gotten my order right twice - how hard is it to get the main piece right every other part of the deal is the same ‍‍‍

This store is going to utter SH*T and someone needs to get a handle on this --- 
Only reason why I go here is because it is right up the block from my house 
Hire better employees because I am about to bring this rating ALL THE WAY DOWN"
506,"Horrible place took 10 minutes in line at the drive thru, then they tell me that will take 10 minutes to make kids meal chicken nuggets. For a new location they will need to improve service. Definitely wont return"
507,"The worst drive through I've been here waiting for 5 minutes nothing , very rude and not personally figure ."" All he's saying give me a moment !"" No energy at all . Get rid of him .. smh"
508,"This place is horrible just left here they gave my friend someone else pizza. The pizza was cold and burnt. She explained to the workers she wanted her pizza re-did over. While waiting for her pizza the next 6 customers orders were all messed up. Customers started to leave bc the food was taking too long or the food was burnt. This pizza hut is the worse one i ever been to. Poor customer service, everyone looks like they hate their job and they are very unorganized. A manager should be on duty because the workers are toooo laid back."
509,Waited for an ice cream cone for 15 minutes while employee at the drive-through was sitting there on her phone. Woman standing next to me was waiting for over 20 min for her meal. Another lady I feel bad for her she was so old and she was waiting for her meal for over 30 minutes before she even got her cups for soda. Very unprofessional. I've worked at McDonald's before I know damn well you're not supposed to have your phone out during your shift.  Next time might as well jump behind the counter and make it myself. I give this restaurant zero stars if I could
510,They put hair in my fried rice and don't refund my money back. I ask people don't come there to buy. Worse customer service ever .
511,"Worst Steak and Shake I've ever been to, stay away.  Food is poorly made, greasy.  Fries not fresh, service is horrible."
512,"Horrible, horrible,  horrible...... you call and give your order. Take the time to drive and guess what..... order is half done. They actually ask YOU, what YOU ordered and they are holding the slip. So it takes 6 people to read a slip and see that the order isn't filled. So after another 10 mins, they say..... Sorry we didn't make your pizza, we didn't see it. Wow, I saw that 10 mins ago. So now, it's 10 mins waisted and another (who knows how long) to cook a new set. I've complained to the Manager before about the service here, but now it's time to make it official.  It's dirty in here and they won't get ya order right. Either spend your money with another Corp or don't go here. Smh. #PizzaHutFail"
513,Says the drive thru closes at 2am multiple times coming here no later than 1:45am to no service.
514,WTF Jimmy Johns??  No lunch for me today.  Would like to give to zero stars.  I ordered a couple of subs and after over 45 mins they hadn't arrived.  My lunch break was over so I called to cancel.  The person who answered the phone told me the manager had stepped out and would call me back for a refund.  They never called back.  Maybe if the manager was at work they could get orders out on time.  They're Freaky Slow and Freaky don't care if you ever get your food.
515,"Just left this place we sat in drive through for over 30 mins, I ordered 2 double steak burgers with fries one with no tomatoes, on one after my long wait my burgers were absolutely disgusting very old cold hard one had only cheese the other one had cheese and one onion The bacon was burnt, the fries were really old hard and cold the order was someone else's order that didn't want it!!! I called to talk with the manager Shay.  She told me to hold on she was with a customer, I told her I was a customer as well, she said what do you want a refund new food or what?? I said please listen to me, she said hold on then hung up on me, I called back the phone rang and rang she never answered I went back the manager started going off on me as if I was in the wrong!! She has a awful attitude and is very rude, the quality of the food and service is the worst I've ever received!! This is my second horrible experience at this place the only reason I stopped there, is my teenagers wanted it!! The manager didn't give me my receipt back, she walked away and never came back to the window!! The young employees were going in and out of the door with their aprons on!! That's not sanitary safe or clean!!! The floor from the drive through window was disgusting their uniforms were dirty one girl had on Nike slides with very very long false nails!! This place needs new management and new employees!!"
516,"10/3/18 10:30 pm.  Just the worst place we have ever stop at!  the manager was a complete ass to me my wife and two kids.  Not only did he tell us half the menu was not available he proceed to tell us  he didn't give a ""fuck"". They we were unhappy 
No looking for free anything but base onthw review of this store you guy need to rap- i. 
Glideinvestments @gmail.com"
517,Worst ever...last time my family and i will visit that KFC. Last three times we have ordered from there and the place wasn't busy...orders all jacked up. NEVER AGAIN
518,"Two different trips to this location. Both being the worst experience I've ever had at any restaurant ever. Inside I was ignored for over an hour and the second trip I took the drive through as it was impossible to park and also I figured they couldn't ignore me if I was in the drive through. They did. They told me to look at the menu while waiting on them after I waited half an hour in the drive through line to even get that far. Then they refused to give me the order because it was an online order and I have to go inside for that. It was impossible to park and I just waited half an hour and it would really be that hard to hand an already made box of food through a window? No other location is like this. No other location has that rule. Nevermind that I didn't want to go inside at all because of the current health crisis. They not only lack concern for their customers, they seem to wish harm upon them."
519,"This is the worst place to go unless you're willing to wait 30-40 minutes in drive thru line and love having to go back after they mess up you're meal. I live in the sun valley area so I've been to this location a few times, in which every single time I go I'm waiting several minutes for them to even take my order. Something needs to be done about this location, hire new people or something but it's trash if you ask me."
520,I walked up after someone had just left in the lobby.  They never even acknowledge me for at least 3 to 5 minutes. Absolutely the worst service I have ever had.
521,This location is horrible and today was my last attempt.. Got there at 12:45 sat at the drive thru but no one answered. Drive around and park to go in.. Open the unlocked door to see NO CHICKEN ANYWHERE...but why you ask? I hear someone yelling at me that they are not open yet!!!!! So they would've just let me sick at the drive thru had I not gone in... The whole crew needs to be thrown away...
522,"This is likely the worse fast food place in Tucson. I ordered two fill up boxes. They said a 6 minute wait on biscuits. I happily understood and pulled up front. They said they would bring out the biscuits. After a 20 minute wait, I still received no biscuits. Stay away from this place."
523,Food was cold I don't even understand how but yes it was cold and when I approached them about my food being cold they just shrugged it off like it wasn't a big deal I try to stay clear of fast food placed but since today payday I decided to treat myself definitely won't be coming back I wish I could give them 0 stars.
524,the owner doesnt know the difference between fake money and real money ! i went in the store to get change for $100 bill and one of the twenty dollars was fake i realized once  i got in the car and when i went back in to get my bill back he called the cops and they didnt do anything about it ! so when you go and they give you bills check and make sure its real i will no longer be doing any business there !!
525,"I'll start by saying that we love Steak 'n Shake; but this location is just horrific.  My family has been coming here off and on for over 20 years.  Each time we come, we say that we'll never come again -- I guess we're masochists, because we eventually come back and have the same experience.  It's a filthy place, your shoes stick to the floor, everything is gross -- I feel like I need a shower when I leave the place."
526,"Showed up at 8:35 but the door was locked and the employee inside gestured that they were closed, even though the posted closing time was 9pm. Went across the street for some delicious Greek food instead that actually closed when it was supposed to."
527,"So this is the worst thing ever.I hate this place because the biscuits were not cooked. The chicken was dry, trash all over the place and the dustbin was leaking and no one cared. Never going back here"
528,"I ordered a dine-in dinner.  I asked for salt.  Christopher, the manager, said they were out of salt.  I said they should have a sign up informing customers they have no salt.  Christopher was copying numbers onto a sheet.  I said, ""Bag up my dinner.  I will take it with me.""  He kept copying numbers.  I said, ""I am an unhappy customer.  Bag up my dinner.  I am your first priority.""  He said, ""No.  My first priority is money.  You have to wait."""
529,Only rated this place 1 star because that's the lowest it'll go. Food is always cold; staff has no clue what they are doing. Wouldn't survive a day when they were actually busy. Easily the worst Wendy's you can go to. Save yourself the money and the time and go somewhere else.
530,"False Advertisement, the Asian Chicken Sucks, just watch the commercial & droll, because they're just old chicken nuggets thrown in some sweet hot sauce, i could have coughed up something better from earlier taste testing @ the Mall's food court"
531,"Doing a delivery, stood by pickup and wasn't even acknowledged for 20 minutes, so I sat down and someone who wasn't even delivering stood there and still wasn't acknowledged. Nobody in the place gas their food, looking at the reviews the quality of the food is terrible (hopefully that doesn't reflect badly on me) and I can't imagine ever having a good experience at KFC. I've never eaten there when the old wasn't like 6 weeks old. A woman's food was left at the pickup window without even calling out what it was or who it was for and it was only because she overheard the cashier's saying it was for some lady and her kid that she even got her cold food at all. Finally got acknowledged at the thirty minute point, guess it's their policy to ignore people who've already spent the money and focus on the ones who still need to sink their cash into the shit hole. God I wish they could make food well because I love chicken much more than burgers. Every KFC I've been to has bad food, this one also has long waits and poor customer service."
532,The service is not so great and the establishment is not very clean sometimes forget your order but the food is great
533,"2 minutes ago

Would give zero stars if an option. Ordered a 5 piece wings through the drive through and was told it would be a 12 minute wait. She told me to pull on the outside of the restaurant and they would give them to me free since the wait was long. After waiting 20 minutes I was told by an employee, that was bringing food to someone else outside waiting, mine was coming out. I waited another 10 minutes before going into the restaurant. After waiting politely to speak to someone I was told by an employee the grease hasn't been turned on for the wings and the were just putting them in, it would be another 17 minutes. I refused to wait that long and told them I already had $45 worth of food getting cold in my truck from the restaurant next door. I thought it would be an easy in and out to get wings for my son but nope. I asked to speak with the manager and she wouldn't even speak to me, she just gave me a dirty look like ""what are you still here for""! I will never give my business to them again. Don't waste your time or money at this place bc it ain't worth the stress."
534,"I was lazy and stopped into the KFC 7245 East Golf links Rd here in Tucson. I made my order and went to the window. The guy said the reader is messed up from dropping all the time. Then he showed me the  register tape showing my card was declined. I let him know that nothing was wrong with my card and he handed me a slip saying it was declined. Now thinking what he had said at the start about the reader. I thought he would be smart and use one of the other registers. Nope the money he makes per hour! Not enough to get him to walk that 10 foot stretch. Before I left the lot I called my bank and they said nothing wrong with your card. I went to Popeyes bought our food there. With the same card!
Lesson to learn! Don't wast your time at KFC."
535,i think someone had a severe diarrhea because they didn't cook the damn chicken right lol
536,"I've never written a Yelp review but this situation deemed worthy of one. I've been to this location twice and I've ordered the KFC bowl which is supposed to be made with popcorn chicken. Both times were a fail. The first time I went there was about 3 months ago, I ordered the KFC bowl and when I got home I realized that there was no fried chicken in the bowl let alone popcorn chicken. It was greasy shredded chicken thigh. They also had me pull into a parking space and wait 10 minutes for the ""fried chicken""....when they didn't even make it with fried chicken. I was annoyed but blew it off as a fluke. Tonight I went through the drive thru and ordered a KFC bowl again. This time they STILL didnt make it with popcorn chicken but instead made it with chicken strips that were just ripped up (again having me pull into the parking lot and wait 5 or so minutes) Apparently they were out of lids for the KFC bowls and they wrapped it up in plastic wrap, making a giant mess of gravy everywhere. They forgot to give us our mac and cheese that we had ordered as well. When we called to see how we could resolve this, they didn't sound apologetic but instead sounded irritated with us. They did however agree to give us our mac and cheese if we came back. I decided to drive back and get the mac and cheese. When I got there, I spoke with who I can only imagine was the manager on duty. I explained to her that both times I've gone there, I had ordered the KFC bowl specifically for the popcorn chicken and neither time did it come with that. When I asked how we could ensure that we get the popcorn chicken with our meal next time, she firmly told me that ""they only had ONE deep fryer that they were working off of and I would have had to wait 20 minutes."" First off....no. I've worked in fast food before and it doesn't take 20 minutes to deep fry chicken. Secondly, there were no other customers there! So what on earth was taking so long? Third and finally, I've been a manager at many different establishments and if that was actually the case, the manager should have told us that the popcorn chicken was going to take a long time to cook and should've given us the option of waiting ""20 minutes"" or asked if we wanted different chicken. Instead, I got attitude from someone who didn't want to ensure her customers' satisfaction. I got no apology and no compensation. Even when I asked if I should call ahead next time if I wanted popcorn chicken, she told me that it takes too long so they just do this instead because she ""didn't think I wanted to wait 20 minutes"". Sooooo I guess this location just doesn't serve popcorn chicken guys. Sorry, you are shit out of luck. Because it takes TOO long. Because they are just TOO busy. Oh yeah.. did I mention that 3 hours before their closing time they had the OPEN sign shut off and all the chairs were upside-down on the tables? I'm pretty sure these KFC employees were trying their best to make the public believe that they were closed so they could get out of there and spend their hard earned minimum wage paychecks on cheap booze and hookers. Ok, that last part was mean (funny...but mean) and I'm sure they aren't spending their money on hookers. But I'm just annoyed and if this situation had been handled with any integrity at all on their part then I wouldn't be spending my night writing this review. I'm not a complainer and I'm a pretty easy going person. I don't expect orders to be perfect or even correct every time. We're all human and we all make mistakes. But laziness and sheer negligence can either make or break a business. Instead of fighting me on how long popcorn chicken takes to cook, a simple apology and maybe offering me some free dessert or something would have sufficed. I don't know these people personally and this is not a petty attack on their character as individuals. But if you want your business to thrive and your customers to come back with smiles, just be sure to give them what they order. If you can't do that, be sure to make that clear to them and offer them sincerity and some compensation. As for me, I'll not be returning to this location. I think I'm going to get into the popcorn chicken industry and make the best goddamn chicken you've ever tasted.....And I promise it won't take 20 minutes ;)"
537,I wish I could give this place 0 stars. DO NOT spend your money here. Food is trash and the staff is extremely rude. My brother got cursed out by an employee b/c his total was $11 and the minimum for delivery is $15.
538,"No words really, just walk in. Dirty.
Also out of cheese, I mean what?
Don't waste your time. We didn't even stay."
539,Worst McDonald's in the world honestly. If you want to wait 15-20 minutes minimum only to get your food and it's cold this is the place for you haha. Tried giving them another chance and I was waiting in drive thru for almost 10 minutes again and hadn't paid yet so since no one was behind me I backed out and left and will never come back. Have fun with the extra food dorks.
540,Sold me a completely raw chicken sandwich. Found out when i bit in to it. Always mess up orders at this location. Super long drive thru times. Terrible management
541,"I witnessed that loud, rude, extremely unprofessional manager person yelling at the real estate people next door.  Someone was double parked. I was parking. He was yelling and cursing that he was calling the police. The folks next door came out to see what was going on. They told him it was a client of theirs and they would move the car. They said sorry.  The pizza hut guy went off. He called the police and yelled and cursed at them.  The parking lot in this place is a freaking nightmare.  All he had to do was say ok and go back in his store.  He was yelling and threatening.  I won't be eating here again.  And they aren't wearing hair nets, they are loud and only the delivery girl has some sense...jesus."
542,"If do really wish one could put a zero star rating. 
An ill neighbor want KFC, so he gave me his cash and I went for him. I had to travel 10 miles to the store, whereas, there were other chicken store much closer. I waited in the drive up line for almost 15 minuets, then made it to the ordering speaker, only to be told, "" We are only accepting credit and debit cards...""No cash.""
""Really?"" I said from my car. ""You mean, I waited 15 minutes in line, only to be told I can't order because I have cash.""
""Yes."" she said.
I had to pull out of line, and drive back 10 miles, to a close chicken place...Church's Chicken, which he was just as pleased with.
If they were in that situation, shouldn't they have posted a sign letting all drivers know they weren't accepting cash because of (their Covid procedure)?

Like I said ZERO star rating."
543,This location is HORRIBLE!!! I have had problems here multiple times. Even had to contact district manager who obviously can not get this place the management they need BECAUSE THEY STILL MONTHS LATER DO NOT HAVE IT TOGETHER! On the last trip We ordered four meals. We waited forever at the window. Once handed our stuff we realized she never gave us two of our drinks. Had to knock on window and then basically argue about how she owed us sodas. Had to ask for straws. Asked for ketchup and she gave me four packs. What am I gonna do with four packs for four meals. So had to ask for more. Mind you the whole time she acting like we are bothering her. Later hubby said she was texting and I had interrupted her when I knocked on window. Once We got home our stuff still wasn't right. Two outta four meals completely wrong. Then when I called I was told to come back the next day so I did. However the person I talked to wasn't there and she didn't leave a message or note for the person who was. So I wasted my gas and time going up there. The next day when I called the person I spoke too was there but now said she couldn't do anything because even tho she remembered our conversation and remembered writing my name and number down she coudknt find it and I didn't have my receipt (she didn't tell me I needed) there was nothing she could do!!!! This was the last straw Seriously I don't think we will ever be going back to this location!
544,Been here twice. Once we got a raw pizza. The dough was like pudding inside. Another time we just never got our order delivered. No answer on the store phone.
545,"This place is horrible.  It's definitely the slowest fast food place in town.  I've gone there once, maybe twice successfully as a delivery driver.  Tonight marked the fourth visit in a row in which I drove over there to pick up an order and had to leave 20 minutes later with no food, abandon the order, and drive off knowing I wasted half an hour trying to pick up chicken from a chicken place that just couldn't get organized enough to actually give up some of their chicken in a sale.  The people working there tonight never once greeted me or acknowledged my presence upon entering, delivery bag in hand.  I went in, waited in the lobby for five minutes, and I was completely ignored.  I went back to the car and considered my options.  I tried calling the restaurant from the parking lot, but of course they have hidden their phone number on Google from the public like shifty degenerates trying to avoid being served a notice.  I went back in and waited another ten minutes in the lobby.  Still I was completely ignored.  And that's why you had to wait forever for your dinner;  you know who you are."
546,Messy food not made how we ordered kids meal had no yogurt iced coffee horrible and bitter
547,Gave myself my boyfriend and my best friend food poisoning!!! Do not go here!!! They shouldn't be aloud to serve food it's messed up how many people have complained and are still getting food poisoning.
548,Never going back.Either they mess up your order or they never send it and take your money
549,Do not order for pick up online! That wait until you get there to make your order! Then get it wrong. It looked like they were doing a good job in drive-thru.
550,"I honestly wouldn't even give this place a participation trophy. We came to the drive thru and ordered a $30 family fill up. The lady on the mic sounded annoyed while taking our order. We pulled up, paid, and were told to go park in front of the restaurant. Under 2 minutes had passed when an employee came out, confirmed our order, and had us on our way with our order in hand. When we returned home, we realized the gravy from the order was missing. However, my biggest problem I had with the order was one of the eight pieces of fried ""chicken"" was basically a breaded and fried bone. The chicken must have been on a hunger strike before the colonel sent him to the cage free chicken farm in the sky. I crushed the piece with my fingers and came to find there wasn't even any meat on the bone. See pictures. I firmly believe this wasn't a simple lack of attention to detail, as it was pretty obvious that this piece was made with no love......just remnants of the chicken's bitter hate and anguish. I don't know if the lady taking my order wanted to make sure my visit was terrible or a server shrugged and thought I wouldn't notice. They won't notice one less customer *shrug*."
551,"I reviewed this kfc about 10 months and it seems as though nothing has changed. I went back to this kfc, because I absolutely love your Mac and cheese, I once again was met with a worker telling me they won't have any for another hour. At 7:30 at night are you kidding me. It seems as though this location has no management at night. It's like a bunch of teenagers have taken over that place and don't have a single care in the world. They always seem to be out of something, like the Sierra mist they were out of last night, or that not enough food was prepared in time. The lack of organization that came from Ashely the drive thru woman and her co workers was abhorrent. I would love nothing more than to give this place money all the time but I won't because it's never a good experience I've gone here about 4 times always bad. Please step up your game it's horrible to see such a loved place be so bad."
552,Who hired these clowns? Worst service I've ever received. I have a stutter and they told me to just leave because I mess up on a word 3 times.
553,"Since there is a limited amount of KFCs, do to locations closing permanently, I made my way all the way down from the SW side of town to Golflinks/Kolb for family meal. 

As expected the line was long (it is the weekend after all) and we waited. The the drive thru cashier (Keyla) was cutting us off as the ordered with an extremely annoyed and bothered tone. She rushed us and as we approached the window, she was still giving a negative and rude attitude. She handed the food upset after we asked her for a receipt. 

I'm not one to complain when I see tired and exhausted ppl attending me at a fast food restaurant. However, I was very I pleased with the customer service delivered. I will not be returning and I hope this fast food ""professional"" receives some type of discipline and training. 

All I hope is that their word stays true to what they state their commitment is: 
""We are committed to using our voice to speak up but more importantly, using this time to LISTEN, LEARN, and act to CREATE POSITIVE SOCIAL CHANGE. We have to do more. We will do more."""
554,2 mistakes in a row w my order. One employee not wearing mask at all. 2 others weren't covering their nose.  A real sh** show.
555,This particular location has terrible customer service. There seems to always be an issue. Today for example I go in and wait for my food I ordered online. I ordered a box of popcorn chicken and they tried to give me a small. When I corrected them and showed them the order on my phone they became rude and the manager was even rude. I work law enforcement all day dealing with rude people and people yelling at me. Don't need it from KFC workers. Never coming back and hopefully others start finding this out too.
556,Went to this location 3 times and each time they were incredibly slow. One car sat at the order speaker for 15 minutes. I see this as unacceptable. It's called fast food not slow food. I think they have the chickens out back and have to kill them and pluck them because they're so slow.
557,"I came here hours before close. The woman through the drive through speaker was incredibly rude with no patience. My boyfriend doesn't frequent here and she was rushing him as well as laughing at him. I have worked this whole pandemic, and a little
patience and kindness would be appreciated."
558,"This place is DISGUSTING! The manager was on meth (no lie). Two other customers were with me in line. We waited for over 30 minutes. They were making pizzas without gloves, wiping sweat off their forehead then back to making pizzas. DISGUSTING! One customer waited 45 minutes for 5 pizzas. Where is the district manager? Ridiculous!"
559,"Can I please give this place zero stars!?!!!
Walk into the place and they have trap music blasting thru the speakers with cuss words mind yourself I have a 4 year old with me. I walk to the counter and he doesn't acknowledge me I ask for a bread and he's slamming things. Doesn't proceed to even ask what kind of sandwich I wanted ....so I walked away. This place is in SERIOUS NEED of a corporate visit and new employees"
560,This jimmys is absolutely horrible i called for a Italian sub NO MAYO BC WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND EVEN PUT MAYO ON A ITALIAN NOT ITALIAN PPL. Anyways i got kicked for asking for a refund and new sub because I'm deadly allergic to mayonnaise. SCREW THIS JIMMY JOHNS. Hope they stick a foot long up their jimmy johnson
561,"I go here a lot and just order 1 or 2 things but always takes forever to get food.. it's called fast food for a reason, oh and 9 out of 10 times I finally do get my food it's cold or poorly put together."
562,"Just like most of the reviewers of already said, this is the worst McDonald's ever. I ordered a large french vanilla cappuccino, I was halfway home before I noticed the cup was only half-full and lukewarm. What a $5 rip off that was. It'll have to be a damn emergency before I ever come back to this location. You owe me $5."
563,"Everytime I come to this KFC,  they're always out of original recipe chicken. I told them I'd wait for a new batch(10 minutes). When it was ready, I was told that there were no breast for my 8 piece meal....2 legs and 6 thighs. No subsitutions on sides either. The employees and manager don't know the meaning of customer service.  Hope they're proud of their one and a half star rating, but I don't think they give a crap."
564,"Unless you have 45 to 60 minutes to wait for drive through food, don't go here. You could eat an entire sit down meal at the restaurant next door before you would even make it to the drive up window to pay here."
565,OMG I came in today to eat terrible place. Fries were good burger was gross. There were people in front of me there chili was gross all dried up I wouldn't serve that to a dog people said that they are turning them in to cooperate.  Other customers left an went to fairview. Please fix things are shut down your messing up Belleville
566,"My wife went last night, didn't even get food. They are now refusing to take anything to credit card. They will not accept cash, isn't that what gloves are made for? Ridiculous. This ownership group should have their franchise pulled"
567,"Absolutely ridiculous that it takes 5 minutes to even place your order at the drive through and 20 minutes to get it. When I asked what took so long, I was told that she's from another store and if it weren't for her, I would have waited even longer. 
This is not the first time service has been awful. They let food sit under a warmer for hours and then serve it. 
Lesson learned. I will not be back."
568,"I ordered take out from here earlier this week. NEVER NEVER AGAIN. The young lady who took the order was shouting all over the place to co-workers while mopping the floor with pine so strong it over took my breathe I had to go outside.  The young lady didn't like that I was asking questions. The look on her face said ""irked"".  No air-conditioning so it was very hot in there. 

I ordered the crab cake platter and they were balls and had waaaay too much Old Bay; all I tasted was that. I could not eat them. The tartar sauce... smh. Their menu states food is in butter sauce. NOT!!! I asked the order taker and she stated it is margarine. Ummm I know butter is expensive but when you are paying $20 for a platter it should be automatic. If it's not butter change the menu. You only get a half an ear of corn. The food was luke warm. My man had the tilapia and that wasn't bad.  We went outside to wait for our food and the order taker never came out to let us know our food was ready. 

Wasted money! I will not be back."
569,Unbearably slow for literally no reason. Hire more staff if that's the issue. This is a brand new location and I've never spent less than 10 minutes waiting in the drive thru when I've been the only car.
570,The worst fast food experience. Starting with the drive thru  order. The young lady was rude and rushing me just to get my order completely wrong. I understand it's fast food and you get what you pay for but there should still be professionalism in the workforce. Never going back.
571,Yep this place still sucks! Stopped here tonight and ordered 12 piece and large gravy and large fries. We were charge for the large but received smalls. Not me ever again this place can just go out of business for all I care.
572,"I went to the restaurant today for the opening. I have no plans to go back. I ordered the hot and sour soup, it was just hot because of the peppers,other than that no flavor. I also ordered the Szechuan beef again no flavor or spice. What a waste of money . Even the fortunes cookies were stale"
573,"Says the drive thru closes at 2am multiple times coming here no later than 1:45am to no service and when I'd get there before 1:45 there would be an obvious attitude from the man taking orders and there was no meat for any ""big burgers"" whatever that means"
574,Absolute terrible service. Liars (say they don't have dressing when they do because they are discriminating) bad attitude (waited 15 minutes for food in drive thru and when it came out the employee had not put all the food in the bag) slow service. Do not give you a receipt because they don't want a bad survey. Will never return again.
575,My family of six went inside to dine. There were a total of 6 other people inside dining. We stood for 10 min prior to being seated. There were several dirty tables that hadn't  been clean. The floor was incredibly sticky! We then sat for 30 minutes without someone coming to our table. We then decided to leave. We will NEVER eat at this location again! Poor customer service and very dirty!
576,"Received complete wrong order. Called the store, was given nothing, told me I'd have to 'contact Door Dash'. Terrible customer service both on the little Caesars & Door Dash side. No way to get my refund. This happens 1/3 times from this store."
577,"First of All, when I saw Church's I got excited...I moved from Missouri 14 years ago. Where I live there is no Church's Chicken. Most people say it's greasy but I have always liked it. Well, it was close to the hotel we stayed at and I was hungry. First thing, I guess the speaker didn't work so you had to order at the window. It was fine since it was only one car in front of us. The young lady was polite and courteous...the food was fast and hot...it went downhill from there. That food was so nasty...on my goodness. It taste burnt....it wasn't burnt which mean the grease was old and the bottom of the fryer was starting to burn. I know it was like 9:50pm. I would of rather been told we aren't cooking anymore food for the night instead of being served and paid for something I had to throw away. Lesson learned. It might be better during the day."
578,"This place is gross and dirty, I never thought KFC would have such a disgusting establishment.  I had to disinfect the table where I was sitting at as it was so dirty. Looks like it hasn't been cleaned for days.  Stay away from this place if you don't want to get sick.  I can't believe KFC and the city doesn't close this place down. Full flies,crumbs and sticky stickiness everywhere."
579,I wish I could give this place no stars but to write this review it requires a star. Well first off they offer me a famous bowl I ask for 3 originals and 1 spicy and they didn't have enough for my order. Second I ordered sweet tea they didn't have any so I order unsweetened tea and they didn't have any. Thirdly I ordered an individual Mac and cheese for my daughter and they repeated my order too me at the drive thru speaker and again at the window however when I get home lone and behold what I had was coleslaw. I call to complain about the coleslaw mistake and they hang up on me. Call me crazy for going back but this isn't the first time I have gotten sick bad service at this particular kfc. I guess I'll just have to switch to a different chicken place.
580,"Well if you don't care about the CLEANEST part of the place being the BLOODY FUNK on the men's room toilet bowl and the funk on the toilet brush and the floor in the bathroom then you should have no issues! Bottom line this place is DIRTY , nasty and full of funk and nasty smells!  Heck watch these guys make their food... the workers are dirty!!  They even touch their hair  and pick their noses they go back to handling the food without even washing their hands!  So if you like nasty dirty places then this churches chicken in Berkley, Missouri is the place for you  That is not normal guys!! I'm surprised a health inspector hasn't shut this place down! (I posted Photos in the photo gallery of this place as well) pictures don't lies they  speak for themselves"
581,The service here was HORRIBLE.  There were a bunch of teenage kids working and were very loud and rude.  I heard lots of cussing and was embarrassed for the mom with young kids sitting next to me.  I was told it would be a 10 minute wait for my order but it was actually 30 minutes.  There were 2 nice girls working (1 on the register and 1 in the back) and 3 boys running in and out basically doing nothing.  This was a Friday night at 5 pm and the waiting area was full of customers as these kids clowned around.  It was a huge waste of my time for mediocre pizza.
582,Just ordered through drive thru and they are out of a lot of things. I received my fries super cold and with out salt. Just the whole experience was poor and disappointing.
583,OK you get one star yummy shakes that's it otherwise nasty I mean it  I came up there gross my steakburger was greasy burnt onion rings do better are close
584,"By far the WORST Wendy's I've ever been to. The food is always old, and nasty. The fries are cold, dry, and greasy. The burgers, and chicken nobody can make because its always hard. Dont make me even get started on the nuggets . Lets just say rocky mountain nuggets (). If i use the bathroom I gotta push for my life they're so dry, and hard. I dont know how this place stays in business. I always seem to give them another shot, and nothing has changed. How hard is it to put the microwave on 60 seconds? Probably leaving it in there too long or something. Wendy would be ashamed."
585,"I've given this LC WAY too many chances... by FAR the WORST LC you can go to. You will wait a MINIMUM 30 minutes if you walk in for a ""hot n ready"" pizza. Order through the pizza portal you say? THINK AGAIN! Your order will be WRONG! Don't bother upgrading to the ""Extra most-bestest"" pizza for $1 more. You're SUPPOSED to see a difference but they literally just give you the same $5 pizza and mentally say ""fuck the customer they ain't gonna know"". You ask for Parmesan cheese - They ain't got it. Red peppers? They get mad like you asked for the fucking register then say they ain't got it. But the funniest thing of all is this shit... the picture I have attached to this review... I mean c'mon guys for real? I could've been you're own flesh and blood and you gonna short me like this, without even knowing me, but why? Like this sauce comes out of your paycheck? Why would you only fill up a sauce cup half way if anything you should be generous because it's NOT coming out of your pocket. What a damn joke. There's a REASON y'alls DUMBASS make pizza for a living  literal BOYS for real."
586,"Went for breakfast they had no eggs. Stick to being a burger joint. 

Btw drive thru only till 9, so dont expect to eat breakfast there, id they ever get eggs back"
587,"Did they bring this chicken to the oven, forget about it. Then served it? It's nearly burnt and the chicken is really, and I mean REALLY tough."
588,I will never be ordering from this location again. I stopped in this morning for a pick up order. The older lady at the counter was very rude and had a very nasty attitude. I waited 10 minutes for her to tell me she never received my order and instead of allowing me to reorder while there she just dismissed me as if I wasn't a paying customer. That will be the last time I ever order anything from this location.
589,Horrible told us to wait for food then came out with horribly cold French fries.  The manager was some huge guy that had no mask on don't go here it's gross!!!!
590,"Yeah let's decide to cancel my DoorDash order after 3 different Dashers attempted to pick up and deliver the food. Let's not cancel the order immediately and waste everyone else's time. After waiting for two hours, they finally decided to cancel the order ""because they're too busy."" Absolutely ridiculous. They should close this location down or hire actual competent people."
591,"Literally writing this review as I stand in line. This place is absolutely pathetic. I waited in the drive thru for 9 minutes, YES 9 minutes with no acknowledgement and there was a car/customer ahead of me, he had the same issue. I'm not even going to get into the fact that there were 3 cars behind me with customers who left. So, I decided to go inside to see what the problem might be. There is a line 10 people long and the employees are literally operating on turtle speed. There is no sense of urgency or even a concern of care for the customers. One has a headset on, but I have yet to see him take an order at the drive thru. 

I never visit Wendy's bc I try to stay away from most fast food places, but I had a taste for nuggets today. I can honestly say I will NEVER step foot in this establishment again or stop by for ANYTHING! This place should be shut down for customer service reasons alone!! Your workers simply don't care and I assume corporate doesn't care either!! 

By the way, Chik Fil A is about 2 miles away, I bet I will see some old Wendy's customers there."
592,"I cannot recommend this location. I have put off writing a review for a while but it is obvious they are doing nothing to improve their service. If you don't want chicken for dinner, then you are in luck, because they often run out.  What KFC runs out of chicken before 5pm?? The last time I gave them a try they had run out of chicken fingers by 4:45 pm. Next time there is a family picnic or gathering and the family wants KFC, I will go to another location."
593,"Worst food place ever been to, these guys need to be fired. Just look at these reviews. How is KFC allowing this?"
594,"i can only imagine the reasoning for this horrible, filthy, rude place to have been shut down.  bye chen!!!!"
595,"Holy Crap!!!! Talk about communication and customer service.... Seriously I have been standing at the counter like a complete moron. One guy asked me what I wanted and then walked off. I've been standing here waiting for someone to actually take my order.

I know there busy and this is just Little Caesars but damn beef up on your customer service skills."
596,"Was under the impression that little caesars were supposed to be 
 ""hot n ready"" 

Bake more pizzas than you do already through out the day and keep someone permanently at the register."
597,Just waiting in the drive thru for 20 min and nobody ever came back for me to order. There were multiple cars in line. Don't be open if you can't serve a single customer every 20 min. Wack
598,"No wonder this place has only 1 1/2 stars. My stepson went there to get a meal tonight. They waited 25 minutes to get the chicken cooked. They served people coming in after them first, Chicken fingers were over cooked and Dry. Paid over 40 bucks for the meals. The Mac & Cheese was the only thing that was good. The mashed potatoes tasted like they came out of a box.  Will never go to this KFC again. The Manager and the Franchise owner should read these reviews"
599,"Sad to say but they have gone way down. At first I had hopes for them but now I could not recommend them. Their food was stale, greasy and tasteless. No freshness at all, such a disappointment."
600,"I placed an order on Uber eats at 11:24 pm, they cancelled it at 12:21 am. 3 separate Uber drivers went there to pick up the order. I work in food service and I am required to complete orders until we are closed and I see no reason to cancel an order 1 hour after an order is placed and 3 drivers waste their time, gas, and money to pick up an order that will never be completed. Then when I place several calls to see why my order is cancelled, of course there is no response. Absolutely fabulous. Of course if it was cancelled WHEN I PLACED IT I could of ordered somewhere else but now because it's so late there is nothing I can do. Fantastic."
601,"This KFC was most awful.. Couldn't get extra crispy, person who took order left before closing, but said she would be there. No one else would help. Nothing written on board or book.. Went again, talked with ""gen'l Mgr"" of that shift.. To call back..
Did not!!! Called again.. New""mgr"" would not make right not help.. Said neither work there anymore!!
I'll never go back... And I'll tell friends + about it!
J. F."
602,"I ordered two 12-piece chicken dinners. One extra crispy and one original fried chicken.  My six sides were: 2 Cole Slaw; 2 Mashed Potatoes and Gravy; 2 Macaroni and Cheese.  The two orders combined included 12 biscuits.

When I got home, there was no Cole Slaw whatsoever. The extra crispy chicken looked very bad, nothing like it should have, but medicore edible. The original fried chicken bucket was a disaster. Over cooked, actually looked like yesterdays chicken refried. The meat was very dark, dry, the meat split and gross.  The biscuits were like hockey pucks and non edible.  The Mac and Cheese looked like it had been scraped from the bottom of a bucket and was a neon orange glumpy gacky gumpus of glue paste cheese, and over bloated macaroni noodles.. unedible.

I called and talked to a counter person who answered the phone.. he actually remembered they forgot the cole slaw.  He didn't have the authority to handle the chicken problem and the Mac and Cheese and Biscuit problem.

So, Cody Berman, the ""General Manager"" got on the phone.. YELLED at me, was abusive to me.  Said I had to drive the 40 minutes each way and he had to inspect the chicken and other products.  When I told him I was in a wheelchair and I had goine to KFC to serve 20 children and they were due to arrive in 20 minutes.. and time and my mobility didn't allow for me to drop what I was doing and bring it back immediately.

He went insane on me, made crude remarks about my problems (handicapped and living too far away, and guests due in minutes)  weren't his problem, they were mine.. and he was a miserable monster.  

I had to yell over him.. and tell him I was going to report him to corporate offices, and I would make sure his ""quality"" product would hit the internet.."
603,This is the 2nd time I have placed a curbside order.  This is the 2nd time I have waited over 15minutes for my order.  SMH
604,"Literally messed up my order multiple times in a row, like what? Seriously i was not about to go back through."
605,"This is by far the worst KFC probably in America. They were extremely disorganized and I believe I saw at least 5-10 different cars leave the location due to the fact that they said they wouldn't be having any chicken for at least 45 mins. Mind you this is during the dinner rush at about 8:30 , when the restaurant closes the lobby at 9 and the drive thru at 10. One would think they would have an abundance of chicken for the 2 remaining hours they are open. I then proceeded to order a large Mac n cheese and was told they wouldn't have any for the rest of the night without an ounce of care coming from the drive thru worker. He almost seemed excited to be denying all of these people food. Good luck staying in business not selling food when your a restaurant."
606,"This Wendy's is trash I just moved down
The street and both times I've been here waited over 20 minutes to get the wrong food and drinks. Go some where else!"
607,"A great place to go if you're a Hindu looking for a fun night out fasting. These simply are the skinniest, and smallest subs. And it's not just this location but it's at all. You pay regular sub prices for a handful. Sorry I'd like to give it a better review but your product needs to come up to industry size standards. If you need an example take a look at a Publix sub."
608,If you want to order your food and not receive it all on the first trip this is the place for you. If you feel like waiting an hour for a couple of burgers this is your spot. Where else can I get an audible sigh when I go through the drive-through and order a chocolate shake. Only here if course!
609,"Ordered a Taco salad, this is what they gave me. Completely moldy tomatoes, cheese and brown lettuce. I called when I got home and pulled the food out out, I called to see what could be done. No response. They are open until midnight and couldn't even pick up the phone at 7:50 PM. I called at least 20 times and left a message with no response. I called the Land O Lakes store and they answered on the first call. I turned my salad into them. 

I also ordered food for my 2 kids and they ate their food in the car before I checked my food. Now I'm concerned about the quality of food they consumed."
610,"Trash absolute trash. If I could give negative stars I would. They've completely messed up 2 of my orders. Food is always cold and they take forever. Recently I ordered a burger and the patties were stale like they've been sitting out all day and the fries too were cold and stale. This last time I asked for a large coke and they gave me cup of seltzer water with a splash of coke flavor. Like you guys didnt see that it was clear coming out of the machine?!?! They also gave me a regular chicken sandwich instead of a spicy one, and I asked for a some dipping sauce and they completely forgot about it. Lastly some of the workers there can be down right rude, so in conclusion dont waste your time or money please."
611,"Waited in the drive-thru for well over 20 minutes.  Once I finally got up to the first window, my order had vanished.  They had no clue what I had, so I had to re-order.  Finally got my food, there was 4 nuggets in my 10 piece box.  FOUR.  I didn't even waste my time going inside to attempt to get it fixed.  Frustrating and ridiculous.  Never again."
612,"Wow, isn't this place special...well actually kinda sad. I'm dinning-in and it took quite a while to place our order and then over 45 minutes to get our food. To add to the cheer, I'm sitting here watching all of the frustrated customers trapped in the drive-thru. It's weird,  the place is nearly empty but service is terrible. 

The waitress took my glass of water to refill and never returned....I think I will return the favor and never come back to this place. 

Other customers are getting the same treatment. One family left after ordering. I wish I would have done the same, wait a minute, while I'm wishing, I should wish I never considered Steak & Shake on Main Street in Belleville."
613,"My wife and I returned from an appointment in Phoenix on Monday, 7/20/21 around 5:30 PM.  We were tired and looking for a place to pick up carryout.  We decided on KFC on our way to our home on the far eastside.  We went through the drive-thru and I ordered a 1 piece breast and wing dinner and my wife ordered a 1 piece breast dinner.  We arrived home in less than 10 minutes only to find what was the worst dinners we had ever had from a KFC.  The wing in my meal was so overcooked that I could not eat it and both of our chicken breasts were almost as bad at the wing.  I had to toss the wing out and managed to east about half of the well done breast as I was quite hungry.  My wife could only eat about 3 or 4 bites of her breast and we threw both of the remaining breasts away.  The rolls were as hard as rocks which neither one of us ate.  Seriously, I think you could have at least cracked a window if you had thrown them at one.  Our mashed potatoes were room temperature.   We have picked up dinners there before and found them to be mediocre but edible. Based on this experience, it is doubtful we will ever return.  We should have called management but we didn't. As a business owner I would want to be aware of this and speak to all of my employees to hopefully rectify the problem so future customers have a belter experience and edible dinners."
614,NO ONE IS WEARING GLOVES! It's like they have no idea what kitchen hygiene is!  Last ever coming here!
615,"This restaurant is consistently lousy.  They advertise specials they don't have and won't honor.  It is impossible to order a meal and not have to wait several minutes for some component they have run out of.  It's not especially clean looking, inside or out.  I am putting this review here because periodically I convince myself they can't possibly be so bad and try them again.  Never.  Again."
616,"Absolutely horrible Wendy's. I waited 40 minutes for my food and when I asked where my order was they forgot I even ordered. Everybody there needs to get fired, don't go here and waste your money and time."
617,"3 times a charm! So I visited this Wendy's which is about a mile away from me when it first opened and I tell you, I never seen such a dysfunctional team! My order was screwed up so bad I refused to return and had not gone for a few years. 3 days ago, I ventured to see if there were any improvements. Moving into the drive thru, three team members were out taking out the trash. One of them wearing the visor upside down gangster style. The other guy was 3 sizes too big for his Wendy's shirt! All the time taking their sweet time getting inside. I had second thoughts but pushed on. There was one ahead of me and was taking forever to order, but I noticed the patron was not talking. Eventually 5 minutes later it as my turn. Took about 3 minutes to come on. Ordered a Frosty and 2 double stacks. Once I got to the window, what I saw explained why this restaurant has such terrible ratings. The attendant seemed to not want to be there. Took my money then walked off. One of the team members called on her, said something then they chuckled. She came back, served my Frosty then took off, texting on her cell. Then, the guy with the small shirt, gut out was there serving my hamburgers. He just threw out the trash. He tell me did I get my Frosty, the handed me the bag and left. That place was dirty and so disorganized it was pathetic to have witnessed. Finally today, wanting to give it one more chance I drive up and I stayed behind the one guy waiting to order for about 4 minutes. Today 09/02/2020 at around 7:30PM. I backed off and left. The guy was still waiting in the drive thru. AMAZING! Who is running that place? There is a reason why the ratings here are bad. I mean...HELLO? Those folk have no motivation, appears to have no leadership nor mentoring. If they hate the job so much then why work there? Patrons are being disrespected as I was. I will never go to this Wendy's again. The people at the Wesley Chapel Wendy's at 54 and I-75 always show happy faces and I can see the manager there helping and totally engaged with his team. Do NOT go to the Wendy's at the Tampa Outlets!!"
618,Good food trash service I guess KFC does not check Yelp otherwise this place would be shut down
619,"I have never had wonton soup in a beef broth.  The egg rolls (I assume they are purchased premise) where completely lacking in taste. I am not looking
Forward to the rest of my food.
Sadly I would avoid this restaurant until there are major changes."
620,"They are freaking terrible, they never ever give you what you order. You ask them, ""hey is this in there"" and they will say yes every time, but will it be when you get home? Absolutely not! When you call to let them know that their stuff was wrong, they want you to spend all the gas in going back so they can give you what you ordered. There is no good customer service at this location. They don't care about their customers at all ever."
621,"Giving them a one is giving them one too much!  This place has been an epic fail my entire 10 yrs in Tucson.  The service sucks!  The management sucks, and they rarely have chicken available and sometimes have to wait 20 min or more.  I thought I would give them one more try. What a huge mistake on my part!!!! HUGE!!!!!!  I ordered a 4 piece extra crispy, but they didn't have a wing in EC which was ok for the wing, but not for the other pieces.  I got home to discover I only got one side.  As I ate my chicken I found a hair cooked into my chicken leg.  Nothing is more gross than that.  I immediately got into my car and returned asking for my money back. Keisha Christian who said she was the manager said NO to my money back.  She didn't care that I was going to report her to corporate either, and btw, there was no one inside, and only 2-3 cars in the drive thru and 3 workers standing around.  No reason she had to be on the window and not come and speak to me.  I created a stir, and she came over but still refused to give me my money back stating it was not something she was authorized to do. ISN'T SHE THE FN MANAGER?  They insisted the hair could NOT have come from them, but I said it wasn't mine, and even though it wasn't one of the male workers it very well could have been on their clothes or from another worker.  I left in a huge huff and was followed out by a worker.  Not only will I never return, I will continue to berate this store everywhere I can!  I see I'm not alone, however. Does KFC care about their shameful workers!!!!!!"
622,"I can't believe this place is still in business. After reading other reviews, it seems everyone has some sort of problem here and management does absolutely nothing to fix it. Well let me just warn anyone who decides to come here, DO NOT and I repeat, DO NOT go here. I remember the first time I had this pizza, and it was from here, and I thought it was the nastiest thing ever. I got sick to my stomach and refused to ever have it again. My roommates and boyfriend on the other hand, enjoyed this pizza, so I'd occasionally have to smell it being around. A few months ago, they got it from this location and I can't believe how rancid it smelt. I told them to be careful because there's no way the pizza they served was remotely edible. It was thrown away because it was just that - gross. Just this past weekend, my boyfriend and his sister decided to share a pizza. And let me tell you.. they both got the worse food poisoning I have ever seen. It was from their pizza sitting out, for god knows how long, developing bacteria. I was so glad and am so happy that I don't eat this junk because for 5 days, they were sitting on and throwing up on the toilet. I've never seen anything like it. It became so bad, they both had to visit the ER because it turned out there was also blood involved, they couldn't breathe, etc. I know it is from this pizza place because it is the ONLY thing they shared. I WILL be calling FDA on them and hopefully this place gets shut down. They should not be a business. It is disgusting and I get that people chose to eat here because .. I mean, $5 pizza .. but that $5 can be spent elsewhere, unless you want to spend $5 to waste 5 days of your life literally feeling like you're about to die. We have records and hospital notes, etc and like I said, FDA will be called. I wish I could give it no stars because I would."
623,"I've had it with this store. I've done everything I can to make it a pleasant experience and they just won't let it be. This time I even downloaded the app and ordered online so I wouldn't have to wait. No dice! ""Chicken will be about 10 minutes "" came the response. Waiting 10 minutes didnt exempt me from leaving off my 8 tenders.  Meanwhile all my food was cold because it was bagged up and ready to go and it (like me) had to wait another 10 minutes. They can't get it right here."
624,I ordered 5 pizzas but they all look like they were made 40 mins ago. One of the worst looking pizzas and employees are the worst. Never go to this place
625,This is by far THE WORST McDonald's in the world. A bunch of rude teens run this place. After like 8pm they say their deep fryers are broken and can't serve anything at all. & The ice cream machine been broke the last 2 years. Not kidding. If you go late hours and they actually are serving food make sure you check the bag they always forget things. This place needs to be shut dowwwnn. New management or something.
626,"This place is ridiculous. They nickle and dime you to death on substitutions. I ordered a McChicken sandwich for my nephew, only pickles and they tried to charge me $.20 for the pickles. I order a Sausage McMuffin with Egg and ask to change the american cheese for white chedder due to an allergy to the colorant and they try to charge me $.20 for that too. Recently we ordered the Big Breakfast and asked to change the sausage for bacon (again allergy) and they upcharge me $.30. Went one night after midnight, ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and get told they don't serve chicken after midnight. I attempted a complaint to corporate and I get a call from the guy that owns this place and all I get is an excuse that bacon costs more than sausage that's why the up-charge. He didn't even address the other things I talked about and he starts off the Vmail for me saying ""I'm looking for (name), I guess.......""  and gave the excuse that bacon costs more than sausage. VERY unprofessional. I am seeking to find out what other restaurants this guy owns in northern Nevada so I can avoid them."
627,Ordered online over a week ago had items incorrect and missing tried to contact both the store and corporate and no response.  Just wanted a refund for the items that were missing/incorrect.  The more I go to taco bell the more I disappointed I become.
628,"I ordered an Italian hoagie with mayo and sweet peppers.  The menu states that it comes with Romaine lettuce, tomato, onion and cheese.  When the sandwich was delivered it was just lunchmeat with mayo and peppers.  I called and was informed that, because of an issue last week with a person having allergies, I have to specify that I want the lettuce, tomato and onions on the ""Hoagie"".  The person taking the order never mentioned that these items were extras when I placed my order.  I was basically informed that it was my issue because I didn't specify this.  For someone that has been ordering from this place for years you would think that this change would have been made known to me.  They took no actions to rectify the order.  I'm guessing that it's time to find another place to order from."
629,I knew they were stingy with the Nashville hot sauce but DAMN even the pickles were dry
630,"DO NOT EAT HERE. I live 2 blocks from this restaurant and will not get food here ever again. We ordered 3 apple pies with our food, was told they were out and gave us a single holiday pie instead. Went in for a refund and in my irritation forgot a mask (I have no problem with masking up and do so all the time). The ""manager"" started filming me with her phone and when I asked why she said it was because I was not wearing a mask and I am required to wear one. I asked if they had a disposable, she said no, so I went out to my car to get one. I told my family what happened and we decided we didn't want the food anymore so I took all of it in for a full refund. While she was in the back getting the refund, a girl came out with a tray full of apple pies. 

So not only did they lie about the pies, they start recording people using their personal phones for no reason and then handle food, which is gross and disgusting.

Avoid this place, they lie, they're rude, and the hygiene is disgusting."
631,Drive thru sucked racist to white people stay away.  Dirty and not caring  it's a complete shit hole
632,"i cheated on my regular pizza place, because their line was busy....smh never again! worst wings ive EVER had, first one i bite isnt even cooked, second one the same....how do you mess up wings????  delivery took well over an hour, because the driver went to a whole other address...needless to say food was cold. pizza was just plain awful, cheese wasnt even melted on the pizza. i ordered a small pizza only ate 2 slices, it was soooo salty. so i gave them $17of my hard earned money to basically get me sick, because thats what happened"
633,"If I could give 0 stars I would. This is the worst drive thru to come to this area. What is going on? They are new and should be running like a well oiled machine but instead they have no idea what's going on, waited 20 minutes for a BREAKFAST sandwich. No apology for the wait. After reading the rest of the horrible reviews I understand now. Please fix this place, it could be run better and so much more profitable."
634,"The most disrespectful staff in the world. Every time we come to this location they never seem to care and there is always something broken or out blah blah. Tonight we went and they were completely out of Mac & cheese and not willing to make more; AT 6:30!! So we ordered something else and they told us it would be about 15min and to wait in the front...okay sure. WE WAITED A HALF AN HOUR. My husmand goes inside to speak to the manager and they said they had just put our order in the oven and would be about 15min. Really!? My husband requested a refund being we hadn't gotten anything and they refused. Both managers and the two staff got loud and demanded we leave. They wouldn't give their names and one employee was acting like he was trying to fight my husband and the others had to hold him back. They finally gave us their names ""Ashley"" and ""Nate"" but i'm pretty sure those are fake. THEY PRETTY MUCH STOLE $30+ FROM US.
Never and i mean NEVER will we return to this location. AWFUL PEOPLE WORK HERE."
635,"I haven't eaten here in months due to bad service. Went there this evening for dinner. Food was hot and good. Service was horrible. The girl that took my money stanched it out of my hand. My frosty lid was broken and not secure on the cup. The cup had frosty all over the side of it. I asked for a napkin to wipe it off and she grab it from me, cleaned the cup and gave me a new lid.  The chilli lid came off in the bag on the way home. No napkins or receipt were given. Probably won't be back again.  She was short and rude with me when I asked a question. If you don't like your job, do everyone a favor and find another one. It hurts business."
636,No need for me to go on a rant about the terrible customer service and complete lack of professionalism. The older reviews still seem to hold true unfortunately.
637,"I wouldn't even give this place a 1 star! Went drive thru
Ordered the 70 piece popcorn chicken! IT WAS NICE 70 PIECES! RIP OFF!

Got home counted tenders! Only 10! WTF?! Tried calling them straight to VM! This location sucks! How hard is it  if u had one job?  

So frustrated!"
638,"From the moment I walked in I could tell this was going to be a bad experience. The woman who seemed to be ""in charge"" was talking to the young guy at the register like he was an idiot. The guy before me asked for plain hamburgers when they were input in to the register and he seen the price he said ""I thought they were a dollar"" and she said ""NOT HERE!"" Walked away and loudly says ""SEE THIS IS WHY I CANT WITH THESE PEOPLE!"" Mind you, it was NOT busy at all. When it was my turn to order I asked if I would get my drink with my food and the guy laughed at me and made me feel dumb for asking but other locations give you your drink right when you order or will hand you your cup. So I feel it's a valid question. Every one who walked into this location within the 5-10 minutes I was there was greeted with a rude attitude. Frankly, if you hate your job...get a new one. When treated like this it makes me wonder how they handle their food if this is how they handle their customers. Unfortunately this was my only option as I was waiting for my train."
639,I order 2 small 2 large lo meins... they give me 3 small and 1 large but charge me for what I order... when I complain they tell me they're too busy to fix it give me a discount another time.. which won't happen since the lady doesn't even know their business is on yelp... do not order from here they don't care about there customers
640,"Omg!! The men's room. Was the most awful with water all over the floor with crap floating in the toilet. ABSOLUTLY DISCUSTING!!!!
The People who run that place are real pigs to let that go and have people walk in that bathroom."
641,"The guy taking the orders at the drive thru is always with out fail rude. Screams at you through there speaker and tries to up sale your order ! I clearly stated Several times ""medium Carmel iced coffee "" when i asked to have it read back he continued to say ""large"". Ridiculous. Everytime"
642,"I wish I could give a zero...they are the worse Wendy's I have ever been to. they take forever with your food and they still get your order wrong. Their food is nasty, under or overcooked and prepared sloppy. And they have no customer service skills what so ever they are rude and argumentative. I ordered at the drive thru today I asked for a chicken pub meal with baconator fries, large. The lady puts it in as a burger I say I'm sorry (I apologized even though she was wrong) I asked for chicken. She huffs and puffs in the microphone then gives me my total. I get my food and processed to pull off and realize they did not give the bacanator fries. So I turned around and bring this to the girl at the Windows attention. Her response was not I'm sorry I apologize or coming right up she tells me, you specifically voided the baconator fries. I say What! no I didn't (I'm confused because I know what I said). she says yes you did it says it right her. I say how are you going to tell me what I said when you didn't even take the order? She says, you got what you paid for! now, while she was arguing with me about what I asked for, the women who actually took my order was making the baconator fries. Because she knows she made the error not me. Instead of her speaking up about her wrong doing or someone telling this girl she is not getting paid to argue with the customer she is getting paid for CUSTOMER SERVICE no said or did anything. I was so discussed by how I was treated I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THERE AGAIN!"
643,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PLACE. I wish I would've read these reviews before ordering. First of all I wrote in the comments to please send plenty of honey for the biscuits and I also added 6 honey from the extras menu just so they wouldn't forget. And they either forgot or just didn't care to look. Also my kids popcorn chicken which was supposed to be a large and there was maybe 8 very tiny almost not edible pieces of it in a huge box like they forgot to put the rest in there. It was old and my breasts and wing were disgusting looking they were so old a they were dry. as well as the fries being old and soggy and the biscuits being so old they were hard and not able to be eaten except the very middle and who wants to pick around their food. Just ridiculous and pisses me off that I spent 30 dollars on delivery for a shitty meal when I could've went anywhere else and gotten way more food and it would've been at least hot and fresh or even almost fresh.
644,"Ordered food here and I hardly ever do! & the time I did, my chicken sandwich was completely raw! I had gotten two orders (meals) . Went back to complain about the sandwich being super raw, and the manager happened to be up front and as I explained that ""this is disgusting, not cooked at all, my husband took a bite and was completely raw"" she responded with ""yeah I know"" I did not like how the situation was handled , no one was rude but also no one seemed concerned at all about the raw meat. Almost like they knew they were giving out raw food! Just before I complained there was other people ahead of me complaining about their food being raw as well! Kids even came in to complain! Nothing was handled the way I expected. The employees and management did not seem to care AT ALL about the complaints! Just refunded the money as if nothing was wrong. I would not eat here at all! If you do CHECK YOUR FOOD!
The manager did apologize but was very short with me and really didn't say anything at all. No conversation about what might of happened or why everyone's food is raw.  Sorry but management here needs to take it a little more serious and run a healthier fast food restaurant for locals. Maybe also consider wearing uniforms & name tags so when stuff like this happens , I would be able to be more specific about who helped me. Back to the whole uniform thing no one looked as if they were in their professional work uniform, no name tag, no logo t shirt. All dressed bunny AF! Salmonella is a real thing!!
ALSO while trying to get my refund and retrying 3 different times, I told the manager ""it keeps declining"" & she said she didn't know why, so I was able to finally just get cash back . I'm seeing people talking about fraudulent..  This location in Sun Valley is disgusting!!"
645,Just ordered this from Wendy! OLD AND COLD FRIES AND NUGGETS. The sandwich was suppose to be a Spicy Avocado BLT Chicken Sandwich. Missing the avocado and gave me a slice of tomato that isn't even ripe. Very disappointed. Also my husband ordered 2 orders of chicken nuggets and only received 1. They kept our debit card and when hubby realized and pulled around to get it the drive through worker had several other cards and had an attitude about it. VERY sketchy!
646,"Placed an order at 7:35 to pickup online using kfc.com (which apparently uses grubhub). My husband showed up and the doors were locked. Though posted hours say 9. He went to the drive thru and all the lights are on but no ones answers. He drives around to the window where someone finally opens and says ""we are closed"". This is at 7:55. My husband let's him know we are picking up an online order and the person replies ""We are closed, we dont want to cook anymore, take it up with uber eats"" and closes the window in his face. 

What the hell kind if service is that!? First of all you had to have seent he order come in, you could have cancelled it then. Instead you choose to close down at least an hour early and offer no apology or explanation."
647,This is the slowest McDonald's on the planet. It takes at least 20 minutes to get through the drive thru.
648,This and all McDonald's After hours never have anything anything on the menu that is Advertise No fries no chicken sandwiches no chicken nuggets No quarter pounders no big Max I think it's ridiculous They should close at 7:00 p.m. every night if that's the case all of those stores And no milkshakes or ice cream either Not to mention the woman was taking our orders on a notebook  It was using a notepad to take my book or my Order
649,"I normally don't expect much from fast food places, especially McDonalds. What I do expect is some respect, especially when I'm being incredibly polite. I took my son here after a rough doctors appointment and thought it would be a reward for getting through it for him. I order him a kids meal and requested a toy for kids under 3 (which I have gotten at other McDonalds no problem) the guy working the drive threw even repeated it back to me. So I pull through and get my food, look in the happy meal box and the toy was definitely not for kids under 3 so I waited and politely told the man working the window that I requested a toys for kids under 3 he grabbed it and looked incredibly confused about a minute later he comes back with who I assume is his manager and he tells me they don't know what I'm talking about, these are the only toys mcdonalds has (which again, I know is not true) I tell him that the bag clearly states that this toy is recommended for kids 3 and older and to ask about special toys for kids under three and he looked at it for a second and handed it back to me and rudely said that those were the only toys they had. So I won't be back to this McDonald's. And my sons upset that he doesn't get the toy I promised him."
650,I ordered and it wasn't until I got to the window that they said they didn't have any chicken. I said you are a chicken place but you don't  have any  chicken . He laughed and said no. In my experience I have to ask if they have chicken. It's absolutely ridiculous that a chicken restaurant will tell you they don't have what they sell. I went and got a hot dog. At least  they have what they  sell. I don't know  how KFC  stays in business
651,If there was a option for - stars this place would be getting that. They have the worst customer service I have every seen as well as the worst management on the planet. I have also never seen an employee be doing absolutely nothing sitting at the front counter with a line of people like I saw. Once I got to the front I asked why she wasn't helping anyone she said she was on break..... what customer service based company makes their employees take a break at the front counter! I will never go back to this place it sound be shut down and totally re staffed.
652,"Literally at the speaker waiting to order breakfast, waiting on the cashier to take my order, they switch the menu boards from breakfast to lunch and will not allow me to order breakfast. This is a display of the 100% lack of customer service... Terrible! You obviously have no concern with customer satisfaction whatsoever. Possible solution, switch over the menu boards from breakfast to lunch but continue to take breakfast orders until your customers start ordering lunch."
653,"Every time I go to pick up food for doordash, I end up waiting forever at this location. Nothing is ready, they are always running out of stuff. There's no urgency from the staff, it's almost like they don't care about their customers. It's like we are an inconvenience to them! Whoever owns this location should be embarrassed! If it was my store I would have fired every single one of them and replaced with hardworking people that strive for excellence. And as I sit here leaving this review  almost the entire store is outside socializing and goofing off on the clock instead of being inside doing what they can to help customers. This ain't even the worst KFC, it's the worst fast food restaurant I have ever been to."
654,Speed of service was a joke during my recent visit. Went inside as drive through was backed up in both lanes.  When inside it was obvious there is poor management at this location. Employees standing around watching and doing nothing. Someone needs to set expeditions and be a manager.
655,So I was walking and wanted McDonald's so I went I found a pube in my food and then in they bathroom there was a dude somking and the food tasted very gross the service was super bad and they were all very rude and the bun was soggy I will never be coming back
656,"On August 25th I entered the Steak and Shake at 4320 West Main St, at 11:35am.  I ordered a diet Coke with two shots of cherry, and a large Chili Mac with extra meat.   The waitress had filled my Coke two times (third coke) when I finally asked her where my order was....IT WAS 12:20 pm (55 minutes after my arrival)   She mumbled something about the order was on its way and something about the pasta not being ready and had to be cooked first and made it sound like she thought I was stupid because I did not seem to know that pasta takes time to cook....Correct me if I am wrong but 25 minutes before noon it seems to me you would have the food ready to prepare for the lunch time visit.  When the order was finally brought to the table it was a little tiny order of chili, noodles and meat served on a small oval plate.  It was probably the $4.00 meal and not the larger order that I had ordered.  Since I had waited so long I did not want to send it back and reorder.   I stopped a young waitress (could not find my own) and told her I wanted to see the manager.  A few minutes later an even younger girl came up and stated she was the manager and mumbled a comment about the pasta or noodles not being ready......They did cancel my bill but they also made me late for an lecture I was supposed to give at the nearby University.   Also I am a priest and was dressed in my collar, cross and clerics.   I MUST SAY I LOVE EATING AT STEAK AND SHAKE AND ALWAYS RECEIVED GREAT SERVICE AND FOOD OVER THE YEARS,  I visit this facility in Belleville, the one in Fairview Heights, and the one in Mount Vernon several times a month. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE RECEIVED BAD SERVICE AT THIS PARTICULAR SITE  RECENTLY AND WANTED TO LET MANAGEMENT AND THE FRANCHISEE KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING.    Fr. Ken."
657,"This is without a doubt the saddest location in the history of McDonald's.
Service has always been horrible, even before COVID.
Newly remodeled outside, this did not change the poor service."
658,Asked Machalla/Nachalla whatever tf her name is for sauce she looked and said something to a coworker and literally did not receive shit. If you don't want to do your job why work there?? I got charged for the extra m&ms on my McFlurry (which is fine because I asked for extra) but they didn't even mix the m&ms in they just put m&ms on top lol SO RIDICULOUS
659,Literally worst mcdonald's i've ever been to. hands down. slowest service i've seen. rude employees. enough said.
660,"I would give zero if I could. We Arrived at KFC and no one else was there ordering. We had to pull the car around and wait for 10 minutes to get our food. Ended up paying $20 For four chicken thighs, One wing, one mashed potatoes with gravy and a coleslaw. When we got home we saw that they had forgotten the two biscuits we ordered, the drink, And the cookie. There were five people working at this location!!! 
My wife repeated the order three times!!!
Next time just invite me in and I'll do the cooking so we can get the order right."
661,"I went to this Steak 'n Shake after a long day of traveling.  It was 1am going through the drive through and the first thing I noticed was the filthy drive through windows.  There was nothing else open that I could see because if there had been I would've left.  The food we ordered was horrible... It was old hard hamburger buns, over cooked beef, we asked for NO tomatoes and guess what we got tomatoes, we paid for salt/pepper fries got cold plain fries, undercooked onion rings.  By the looks of the other reviews this type of service has continued and it probably is irrelevant to the company to fix these issues.  If you have a choice don't go there or you will be writing this same type of review."
662,I'm pretty sure the sauce they gave me has mold in it. It smelled really bad and looked fuzzy. Definitely not eating that. Maybe the sauce should be stored in a fridge or something. Saw it getting pulled out from under the counter so I'm not really sure what's going on down there. But ya check what you're giving your customers. Kinda nasty
663,Found snot in my food so disgusting. I told the manager and she laughed. If I could I would give this zero stars. Unless you want this in your food don't eat there.
664,"if I could read this place zero stars I would. I don't understand why they offer a 24 hour service with a limited menu. I was waiting in the drive-through for 30 minutes before I approached the intercom to order, I was then told to wait a little bit longer which was probably another 20 minutes to then find out that their menu was limited. The customer service was horrible, I can only imagine how unsatisfying the food taste."
665,I am at this Wendy's currently in the drive through and literally waisted no joke 38 mins waiting in line for someone to take my order. The employees are coming outside to take the trash out and cigarette breaks as we wait outside. This happened last time I was here too. Terrible customer service and when I get to the machine to take.my order it's not even working properly and the guy puts me on hold for another 7mins and people behind me start honking at me! This place is total trash! Don't even waste your time! Go to McDonald's across the street!!!!!
666,Okay so today is January 4th. It snowed today. My mother and I called PIZZA HUT at 9:40pm to place an order. They were acting as if they didn't know anything about wat they were selling. Normal questions like do u have any pizza specials. They took my order an said it would be 20min. Cool. I get there a white guy with long hair is in the front. So I realize the door is locked. So I'm knocking on the glass. He won't even look my way he goes to the back of the store where there's a black peazy head guy who also ignores me. So I'm like I called my order in(screaming) they're in the back of the store. If ur closing why take orders an then when I come the all the way from 3miles away in the snow ur not courteous enough to explain why u had me come all the way there for nothin. Very Ghetto an rude and Pizza Hut shouldn't want to be associated with anyone that handles customers like this. This is how people get hurt. It's not the fact that they closed after took my order but they didn't have the decency to explain why I'm waiting outside knocking on the door. In the snow all for nothing. They both should be fired. I would never write a review so you know I'm pissed tf off.
667,"I am convinced that every fast food joint around the Willingboro area is the worst places to eat this service is awful the food is awful
This is what happens when you hire uneducated people who have no morals or manners
They can't read you can't write how in the hell are they ever going to get your order right
Save yourself the agony drive 10 minutes out of Willingboro to go get food somewhere else"
668,On a Tuesday morning we pulled up to the drive-through with other cars in the drive-through and were told by a person outside the restaurant that it was not open yet this is at 11:15 AM very disappointed.
669,"Absolutely dreadful experience... have seen people come in & stand just waiting to be seated but are ignored because the waitresses are busy talking behind the soda machines or hiding in back. Have been forgotten about after being seated. Was given cold chili & told it was ""freshly made"" which was why it took so long...
Have been given sticky disgusting menus, attitudes & best of all THEY CHARGED OUR CREDIT CARD TWICE. 
.....Decided to go back a few months after that in hopes service was as good as it used to be. Was shown right away that was not the case. These workers were MAKING FUN of a mentally challenged man sitting in the restaurant. They criticized his order when he asked for extra bananas in his shake. I was appauled. To end the experience, we witnessed a family walk in, just to be ignored to be seated once again. We walked out & did NOT pay...needs to be under new management..HIRE A NEW STAFF ALREADY..!"
670,"On 8/15/16 at 3:10pm we experienced the following:
1-Employees were constantly going in and out, smoking or visiting with passerbys.
2-Tables were all filthy as well as the floor.  God forbid what the restrooms looked like. Slipped several time with my cane.
3-Flies were terrible landing on our food, table and bodies.
4-What we ordered was not available.
5-Got a chicken fried steak without a knife.  Asked the young man for a knife and butter for our biscuits, but never got them.  Went and stood in line and by the time I got back to the table my husband had eaten his steak with his fingers!
6-Poor service, poor food and deplorable dining area.  We won't be back and will let our friends know how your restaurant presents itself.

Shame management!"
671,Never seems to be open. Which is big blow for a fast food restaurant on the busiest part of the south side.
672,You know you are going to sit and wait for you meal. All they do is fried chicken and the wait was over 20 minutes like a new record for personal best for this location. Bring a book. Que up in line. Pitch a tent. It is a comically long wait. Food worth it? Maybe. Don't forget the biscuit. Rookie mistake
673,"Just picked up an eight piece meal, the green beans were disgusting, very sour, they tasted like they had too much vinegar or something, me and my mother both have just a little bit, and Are saving them for testing in case we get sick. The chicken was cooked too long, dry and tasteless, I can't believe this restaurant serves food like this, I will never be back. If this was the last restaurant on earth and my family was starving to death, we will starve to death before going back to this so Called restaurant"
674,"Just ordered the spicy chicken nuggets and waited for the food. The woman came out to bring it to me and I drove off. After going up the road a few miles I grabbed them out of the bag and noticed it was a burger. I turned around and came back and I told her she gave me the wrong order. She was rude and said ""no that's what you ordered"" and then charged me for a new order of chicken nuggets I will NEVER go back here. Horrible customer service"
675,"I waked in and it was very dark, even though it was the middle of the day i still felt like i was in a dark ally about to be reped at gunpoint. The workers kept looked at me, uncomfortably staring and asking me if i lived in the area. There were small children crying in the distance, but no parents to be seen. I have never felt more unnerved in my life, it was like i was being hunted. My food was surprisingly done quickly, but it had a strange oder and my drink cup was sticky. The fries were cold and a there was a gum rapper in my bag, when i left the store a small man came up to me and asked for some change, he was wearing a McDonald uniform."
676,I live about 1 mile from the Sun Valley McDonalds so I have gone to this business many times and every time My order is wrong EVERYTIME Not just once in a while EVERYTIME Tonight I have called the Phone number listed and I get voicemail Mo call back I am tired of spending money with this branch and not getting what I order Tonight I ordered a triple cheeseburger I got a single with 3 slices of cheese Almost right but not quite right Something needs to be done with this manager It never gets better always worse You will get no more of my money Your store should be shut down I'm still waiting for a call back I want my money back and I will get it...
677,"Placed my order at the drive up. Got to the window, asked the gentleman to repeat my order. Everything was correct. I pay and look at my receipt. It's wrong. I tell him it's wrong. He smiles and says he'll fix it. Wait 20 minutes and still get the wrong food!!!  Gave it a try again a few days later and the same gentleman helps me. He has no real clue as to what he's doing. The problem is he doesn't understand English. Very nice gentleman though. Never go again to this location."
678,"I came to this restaurant with my partner. We ordered online, because the drive thru line was ridiculous. Their lobby was closed. ""No problem,"" we thought, ""we'll call, and see if they'll bring our food out to us."" 

No one answered the phone. 

So we waited for 20 minutes in the drive thru line. When we got to the speaker, they told us to wait out front. We were given an order that was missing a drink, with chicken strips half the size they usually are. My drink was just carbonated water, and they were out of iced tea. They asked what I would like instead. They did not wait for a reply from my partner, and just gave us two of what I asked for.

On top of all this, the drive thru is atrociously designed, trapping you in the line as soon as you get there.

Avoid this location."
679,No vengas a esta Vaina dan las Órdenes mal y no marica así no y luego les dicen pendejos a los que compran entonces no compren aquí
680,Horrible customer service and the pizza quality is not worth it anymore! I tried calling to report sour crazy sauce and there I no answer! I'm going to be Upset if I have to go over there cause no one is answering! Ugh! There's always something every time! Don't come here to this location only if you want to experience disappointment and the most horrible customer service of your life!!!!
681,It's been a good place before now is turned into a dirty and ugliest faces that never smile
682,Like WTF! McDonald's post have happy meals not let me go home and see wth I paid for. My burger looks like they thru the thing against the wall. WTF did I do. I order food and patiently waiting in drive thru line. To come home and say wtf. Service quality extremely low.  I can't believe the manager even let this leave fast food chain. I never been more disgusted in my life. Please have god dam manager do there dam job read review and re train your dam food line.
683,Who in their right mind decided it was a good idea to give kids medium sodas with a happy meal?!  I ordered 3 kids meals and specifically asked the employee for kid size drinks. After paying at the first window the second window employee handed me 3 massive drinks. I asked her why I was given such large drinks when I asked for kids meals and kid size drinks and her excuse was that the machine automatically makes them medium drinks. What child needs this much soda?! I asked if I was charged extra for the massive sodas and she wasn't even able to tell me. To top it off the fries are cold.
684,Wort customer service I have ever received. They didn't have chicken one night and another night they only had grilled chicken. How can you be a chicken restaurant and not have chicken?? Someone explain to me!!! I would give no stars if I could.
685,"I have eaten at other KFC restaurants around Tucson and this one is by far the worst! The first time I had placed an online order and when I arrived to pick it up, there was a sign on the counter indicating where to go to pick up online orders. I proceeded to the counter by the sign and waited to be helped. After a few minutes of waiting, one staff member looked and me and snorted ""is there a reason you are standing there?"" I explained I had placed an online order and the sign indicated this was where to stand to pick up an online order. She then told me most people wait over there and pointed off to the left. I explained that this was not my facility but the sign was clearly posted on that counter which is why I stood  here to pick up my online order. She rolled her eyes at me, asked for my name and got me my order. Another staff member came over and apologized on her behalf and gave me a dozen cookies.  The second time I had gone through the drive-through and had to park and wait for my order to be brought out to me. When it was brought out to me I checked it and it was wrong so I went inside the store to get it corrected. The staff, collectively, were very rude, very disinterested in helping or doing their job and obviously unhappy. I would recommend you skip this store and find a different store to get your KFC!!"
686,"Took an employee 5 minutes to ask what we wanted to order. Then it took 10 minutes for our food to come out. It was not busy inside, they had one customer so this was unacceptable. They didn't apologize for the food being late. Fried tasted microwaved and burger was not hot. Won't go back."
687,"Eat if you wish to die an untimely death. Disgusting beyond belief.

We went, desperately hungry, and left, hungry still with quesy stomachs knowing we were bound for a case of the runs (or worse). Lukewarm, low quality, food that is clearly unsafe. The health department must shut this place down. Congealed soups. Ew."
688,"Went through for a coffee this morning. Looked in and saw this NASTINESS! Oh WOW, has this EVER been cleaned?? Not sure if the picture captures it, but there is actual mold. So gross! This used to be the best and cleanest McDonalds around. Granted, I can't remember the last time I visited a McDonalds, and this was likely the last ever. I'm so disgusted!"
689,Worst fast food restaurant ever. On 3 separate occasions they ask me my order 5 times when I pull up to the window . The third time they didn't even have my order on the computer. Never going back. Can you please hire some competent employees?
690,"Fries always taste stale and old and the container is usually only halfway full. Such a ripoff. Even though this location is closest to my house, I will go out of my way to avoid it from now on."
691,"Wow...stopped in last night to grab a few cheese burgers and apple pies. My daughter and I waited in line forever then when we got to the window we were told we had to wait. After another 10 minutes we went in to ask where our food was, only to find out it had just been sitting there because nobody there knew what they were doing. Regardless to say our food was cold and that McDonald's is off the list."
692,"Cons - The place is dirty.  Had to stop in to use the restrooms and they were filthy.
- The floors were dirty
- The Service was bad.  Slow and unfriendly staff
- When using the drive through, they have NEVER gotten my order correct.  There is always something missing or incorrect,
- Frequently get the drink wrong.
- Staff acts as if they could not be bothered.

Pros- Compared to other fast food locations in the area, their service is horrible.

For groups of people who want $15/hr as a minimum wage they are not working at a pace or ability to be worth the $15/hr.  Why can other businesses in the area hire much more qualified people than this McDonald's?

I highly recommend going to one of the local competitors, Jack in the Box, Taco Bell, Steak N' Shake, Hardy's, Wendy's, et cetera.."
693,"I'm sorry, but there's absolutely no way that your shake machine has ""just gone down"" or ""locked"" EVERY SINGLE EVENING I've come by over a period of months. Seriously, months. 

Just be honest & tell me you don't want to clean the machine so I can just plan to go to Steak & Shake."
694,This place is out of control. Service nonexistent food disgusting and the place was empty and dirty at 7:00 on a Saturday night. Complete waste of time!
695,"2 workers in the entire restaurant. Doing the drive thru, dine in, cooking, running food out to cars. Took them 5 minutes to take my order. There was no one in line or in the restaurant eating. Took them another 10 minutes before i got my food. Good was ok. Management is sorely needed. Sorry to say that I will not be a Burger King customer any time soon."
696,"Service is consistently terrible. Shouldn't be too hard to fulfill an order for a Diet Coke, but today's crew was too busy talking on their phones to bring it home. Pushing the ""extra ice"" button on the machine to keep costs down was a nice touch. Apparently you have to ask for straws too.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this McDonalds."
697,"Our  grandson begged to go to the McDonald's with the play area.   Never again.  The whole place is filthy.  The tables, the highchairs, the floor, the bathroom...YUCK!   I was afraid for him playing in that climbing apparatus.  The young woman waiting on us must have been new, because she had to ask other workers about everything.  She had an attitude that she just did NOT want to be there.  She didn't ring in the coffee we ordered, or give us cups for our water.  Another worker apologized and gave us the coffee free.  There was a very unclean sign leaning against the wall in the bathroom that warned about a wet floor.  Actually, there was water all over the floor behind the toilet.    Never, ever, will we go there again."
698,"If you ever order from this Pizza Hut USE CASH ONLY my total price was 13.11 I used my credit card, several days later I get an email from the credit company informing me about a $6 tip that was added to the final price making it 19.11! Which I definitely did not leave, because I never leave tips over 3-4 dollars especially with carry out service I picked the pizza up myself. It's not that $6 is a lot but it's the principal, who ever altered the receipt is basically stealing from me! Today is Thanksgiving so I can't call customer service to get it resolved but first thing tomorrow I will be calling for my refund!"
699,I told my husband going here was a terrible idea and I was right. Food was old and reused. Saw server's child put vanilla pudding serving spoon directly into his mouth and then back into bowl. Just disgusting.
700,"If I would have read the reviews earlier I may have just skipped this location and went across the street to Steak N Shake....I ordered the fries, cheeseburger, and vanilla shake...the shake came out and wasn't mixed and looked fake yellow with white on top....the cheeseburger was cold and had about half a cup of minced onions on top--waaaay too many.....and my fries were cold and not salted....hmmmmmmm not sure why I ate that mess but I did ---next time I need to make a better choice..."
701,Yup still as slow as before. Ugh makes no sense. This is the only location I've ever been to where it is a minimum 10 minute wait in line. I really just do not get it. I'm sitting in line at the drive through as I write this review. So far I have been in line through 4 songs. LOL thats how I time the wait. So you figure I've been here at least 12 mins. Now I continue to wait because I want to see if the receipt shows the time I placed my order...........ok finally. Placed my order at 10:15 received it at 10:30.
702,"I've now spent 15 minutes in line at this location. If I were receiving a steak dinner, I'd be okay with this, but all I was ordering was a normal burger. Places like this should be shut down and replaced with local restaurants that hold a higher standard.

Good McDonalds are harder to find than good Trumps with the first name Donald."
703,"Absolutely filthy. Trash all over parking lot. Dirty surfaces absolutely everywhere. Bathroom floors walls doors dirty. No toilet paper. Restaurant floor so dirty and sticky that shoes made noise when walking over several sticky areas. Flies on the soda area!!! NO ICE. One positive--the woman who waited on us. Polite, smiling, helpful, completely out of place in such a horrible place!! We couldnt eat in--no clean tables--took food to car. We stop at McDonalds on road trips because they are almost always clean. This place is a nightmare!"
704,"The service here is always horrible! The delivery times are always an hour at minimum, and their customer service is always slow and rude. It never seems like they have enough people on staff."
705,"Horrible management of a restaurant . Decided to get mcdonalds after seeing all the commercials  about breakfast all day . Order was not accurate and the food was cold . If you want bad service, cold and missing food - come to this location because they will not disappoint when it comes to that . Called to complain and could not even talk to a manager, so it's clear the restaurant does not care if they lose customers or have bad service ."
706,Worst McDonald's ever!! Lobby is always dirty and they NEVER get my order right...trust me people check your orders before you leave.
707,Just wanted to add that obviously either the number on the receipt is wrong or management doesn't care to call a customer back. Horrible place.
708,Apparently this McDonalds only stays open until 10:50. Don't bother coming here close to closing time.
709,"So slow. Only one register, cashier leaves mid order, only two drinks in the machine, flies everywhere."
710,Honestly this place never gets my order right.. not only that but I've received cold fries on more than one occasion. Today I went and my chicken sandwich was old... you could tell it was past its time and they served it anyway. I've given them three chances because they are so close to my work.. I'm done going here
711,"This Pizza Hut location is TERRIBLE! Each time I ordered, pizza was cooked completely different. My delivery driver came 56 minutes late and had he nerve to stand outside and take a smoke break first.  The food was cold! Called the store and she told me that they only had 2 drivers. WHY is that my problem? If they guarantee a time (which is already and hour and 15 minutes out), it is unacceptable to be 56 minutes late. She offered me $6 off when it should have been free. The pizza wasn't even worth it."
712,"Gross. Food is pasty and cold. Should have gone to bk in same parking lot for better food instead. Waitress ignored us- no drink refills, no plate clearing. Not enough silverwear on the table. No one brought us any, no napkins either. Don't go here."
713,"Im mad, but I knew better. This place sucks. My Big Mac was dry and had too much sauce. How does that happen? Burger patties were about the size of precooked sausage patties. TONS of lettuce, I love veggies, but it didn't taste fresh. Bun was soft. Although, it was kinda crispy? When I bit it. Strange. My kids spicy McChicken was pretty ok. Too much mayo for me and chicken would have been better if it was warmer, fresh cooked. Was really hungry and tired."
714,"I've never witnessed such SLOW service at a ""FAST"" food restaurant. They aren't even apologetic about it. They should really consider firing the entire staff bc every time I think maybe they are just having a bad night... but it's happened time and time again. And you just hear the morons snickering in the background. Seriously whoever owns this establishment... it's terrible."
715,"We placed our breakfast order and 20 minutes late we received our meal with wrong meal items. After getting the orders straightened out, I noticed drive-thru customers going into McD. to complain that their orders were incomplete or missing items. 
Manager was very polite, however the crew seemed lost."
716,"Absolutely unacceptable experience. 

I have ordered from here several times for both delivery and pickup. Last week, we ordered with a 35 minute estimate, and after 1 hour and 20 minutes called the restaurant to ask about our pizza. We were hung up on twice, and finally put on hold for 5 minutes only to be told that our order hadn't left the building. The person on the phone was incredibly short and rude about it, and hung up on me when I told her to cancel the order.

Then, I received a call from ""customer service"" to confirm my cancellation. When I tried to talk about the issue, I was rudely cut off and the caller rattled off the ""discount-time policy"" to me. Essentially, I was told to sit and wait for my pizza (it was 11pm at this time) and whenever it came I would get a $ discount based on the amount of time after the window. So, essentially, wait more than two hours for pizza, receive no call that it will be late, and screw off. 

This really wasn't even about the discount at this point, it was ultimately about how rude and unpleasant everyone was being.

I emailed the company the next day. Received a can email ""will contact you in 3 business days."" Guess what didn't happen? Emailed back, received a canned ""escalation"" email for another three business days. In 19 minutes that window is up, haha.

I don't expect much from chain pizza, but Pizza Hut couldn't even meet the ABSOLUTE minimum."
717,"So this Burger King was different. An unruly bunch of workers behind the counter. In the thirty minutes me and my family was there, we got to see: four incorrect drive threw orders, two incorrect dine in orders, and an argument between the line cook and the drive thru  cashier. The manager had to take over all aspects of running this Burger King to get the crew somewhat functional. On top of that stuff; the drink machine was out of ninety percent of drinks, there was no ketchup, and this place was filthy. 

DO NOT GO HERE. You were warned."
718,"Drive thru wait is way too long even when i was the only car waiting. I thought maybe the wait is worth it.... What a disappointment the burger was cold, lettuce and tomatoes were wilted. Old fries but at least they were warm. One star for the cold sweet tea."
719,"Every time I go to this location for lunch and even after work, this place is always closed. The first time I went, there was a sign stating they were closed for the day. The most recent time, there was no sign. Does anyone know if this place is permanently closed?"
720,Supposed to receive honey BBQ wings and I guess this is what this is. No effort put into it at all. Will not be ordering from this location again.
721,Just had Raw/stale chicken Nuggets from this location had to throw all 12 out pretty mad Cause that's money gone to waste ...
722,"The last two times we ordered the chicken barbecue pizza, it was missing the barbecue sauce. Okay, a little irritated but honestly it could have been a new ppeson training or just so busy they didn't notice. Not a huge deal. Tonight I called and Shanel took my order and was SO rude. She said something twice and she was talking fast and I could not understand what she was telling me. I explained I couldn't understand what she was saying and she decided she would treat me like a deaf 3 year old. I was completely shocked at how rude she was when all i was trying to do was understand her. Ok long story short she was saying to have my ID when they arrived since I used my bank card. No big deal but I've never been told that. She continues being rude and nasty. When the driver arrives hes completely shocked that I am trying to show him my ID. I ask him who the manager is and u guessed it-- Shanel. I have contacted their corporate office but wanted to share my latest experience. I realize everyone has an off day, but this went way above just a bad day. She should not be allowed to speak to people in this manner. I hope they will just listen to this phone call. So sad because tonight the food was actually made correctly and was delicious, but I don't pay any buisness $33 to act so nasty. Not a second time anyway:\"
723,"Worst Chinese buffet ever! Went here with my wife and baby. My wife ate one piece of sushi and it was disgusting! I had a piece to confirm this and by looking at it you could tell it was sitting out all day! I even went to the hot bar to try something else and it was all horrible! We got up and told ""the manager"" who probably couldn't understand English well. He said he would take 10% off of the bill for the little food that we tried. I ended up giving the greedy pushy bastard $10 for a couple pieces of old fishy sushi and a few pieces of some nasty gen tso's (hopefully) chicken. WE WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE AGAIN! AVOID THIS FOOD POISONING TRAP AT ALL COST!"
724,"I didn't think a Wendy's was capable of getting 1 star... this one is. 

I just attempted to order their new Gruyere bacon cheeseburger.... instead i somehow left with that $4 combo meal....or that was what i was charged for. The receipt said $4 combo-- jr bacon cheeseburger, nuggets, dr. pepper, fries.... I got the burger and fries lol. It's almost funny.

I specified at least 4 times, to the point of being pushy, that my boyfriends burger was not to have mayo on it... receipt said no mayo.... there was mayo. Poor thing HATES mayo, so he ended up eating his burger sans top roll entirely. Definitely dramatic to me, but I still felt horrible for the poor guy!

Definitely a weird Wendys.  Having worked in the retail field for 9 years... I'm just a little perplexed that my order was SO wrong lol. I think the girl was too busy laughing with her coworkers to hear me properly. I could barely hear her when placing my order..."
725,This place is horrible!!! Do NOT eat here!! The food was cold. The service was horrible! I slipped and fell and all the lady said was sorry. She said there was a sign on the side of the aisle but I wasn't even on that side! So I went up to her and told her what had happen and I took her over where I had fell and she moved the sign over to where I fell. Then came over to my table and pushed on my bruise! Never again am I going there!
726,"Absolutely terrible. Employees stood around and watched an a line of people waiting for their order to be taken grow. No sense of urgency. Stood in line for 15 minutes, then when it was brought up that we waited they argued with us about it. One said she ""didn't want to go to jail today"" and walked off. Nasty bathrooms."
727,Took 35 minutes to be served our simple order. They were incredibly slow and no effort to speed things up. They kept taking orders but no food was coming out! No apology from manager when I pointed out our 35 minute wait. Food was cold when we finally received it. This seems to be the norm for this location.
728,"Worst Pizza Hut ever!!!! Pizza Hut   Supposed to be one of the top places  around but not this one .  They always tend to serve The food over cooked.( or atleast everytime I buy from them it all has the worst taste ever.  They need to get it together People pay for food to eat it not to Throw it away.
Second review : I was feeling some pizza but when I got there they attended me sooo...... ugh I'm so uncomfortable there like the people that work there are just so ..I rather not say anything but omg the foood! FUCKING DISGUISTING! WTF DID YALL MAKE THE PIZZA THEN EAT THEN SHIT IT OUT THEN PUT IT ALL TOGTHER AND THEN GAVE IT TO THE CUSTOMER? THE DEVIL HIMSELF WONT EAT THAT"
729,"When I last wrote a review about the Southampton Wendy's, I bumped them up a star for taking a firmer stance on making sure customers' orders are accurate. Today, that star gets taken back after a moment that I can only describe as, to say the least, VERY unprofessional.

I stopped in today for a double combo, with lettuce and onion, and no cheese. They even confirmed that there would be no cheese on the ordering screen. Seems normal. As soon as I pull up to the drive through window, they hand me my soda - again, normal. The next part is where things get interesting. After about a minute or two without my food arriving, the worker all of a sudden asks me ""What was your order again, the double with cheese?"".

Double whammy, right there - not only does the worker briefly FORGET what I had ordered, but when he does remember, he STILL cannot get it right. I asked for NO cheese - again, he even put it up on the screen when I first ordered it. So, I correct him, and he then quickly makes another sandwich. This next part is what really seals the deal.

It isn't a double without cheese. It isn't a double WITH cheese. No, he gives me a TRIPLE, that does not even have lettuce or onion on it. At this point I am so annoyed that I ask them to remove one patty from the triple and put lettuce and onion on it. They do not even get THAT right - although they did add the lettuce and onion, they didn't remove the patty (perhaps the manager told them to just upgrade my combo to a triple to make up for it, I don't know). It certainly didn't help matters that the food was just as tasteless and bland as it usually is here.

With that said, there is certainly no doubt in my mind that Southampton Wendy's is now officially a trainwreck again (or at least more so than when I first reviewed it). When you put your foot down on people not getting orders right, you KEEP that foot down. You cannot let up for even a microsecond or things will go back to the way they were, very quickly, such as was the case (and then some) here today. That said, I will be taking my business across the street to McDonalds from now on, where people can actually get orders right the FIRST time.

You had your chance, Wendy's of Southampton. You officially blew it."
730,This place is so slow! If you don't have a half hour don't sit in the drive thru. I have been here twice and both times they had me waiting for food after payment. I had to get out of my car and go in to get it. The time before my food sat in a bag at the window for 5 minutes before they  handed it to me. Terrible service and the food tastes like it was sitting all day. I won't be back.
731,"Bathroom had a dismantled cigar that someone obviously had gutted too roll a joint. No Coke, no Dr Pepper, sweet tea was being dispensed from a bucket with cups..... Container salt and pepper was in on front counter was caked in dirt. Was given part of our to go order only to let it get cold while we waited on a chicken sandwich from our order."
732,"It had to be pretty bad if I'm taking the time to write a negative yelp review for a McDonald's, right?

Placed an order thru Uber eats. After waiting an hour I got a call from a the McDonald's manager saying ""they're going thru renovations and stuff is flying in the food"" so they were cancelling my order. How nice. Guess it's better than flying debris on my burger. Thanks McDonalds."
733,"Sign says open 24 hours, yelp says open 24 hours, people ""working"" inside. Order screens turned off. Called the store and asked if the drive through was open and she said no. I asked why the sign said 24 hours and she said it was just on the weekend. It's 1am on a Sunday night. Just wanted a dang cheeseburger."
734,Worst fast food place I have ever been to. Stood at the register for a couple minutes before I had to ask somebody standing around to take my order. The people behind me their coffees first before they had to brew more. Every table was dirty. Didn't get the hot sauce I asked for.
735,"They make you pull up at the drive thru so they dont run their timer up. I was the only person in line. I pulled up and 30 seconds later a lady brought my food to me meaning it was completely unnecessary. On top of that when I refused to pull up and wait at first, I got attitude from the staff. Also my drink tastes like they havent been cleaning the drink machine. No point in complaining to management at this Burger King. They obviously do not care. Heres your one star."
736,"This was awful. Orders wrong, terrible customer service, and not very clean. Not impressed"
737,"I only give them 1 star, because last week I got good food... But today, I got 2 son of baconators, 2 potato's, and 2 med drinks, and got jammed almost $30 for slop!   Potato's were raw with half melted cheese and raw bacon! Sandwiches were greasy as all hell, couldn't eat them! Sour cream packets were filthy! Soda's were flat! No straws, no napkins, and to top it off NO RECEIPT!  THIS PLACE IS THE WORST WENDY'S ON THE PLANET!!!! AVOID AT ALL COST! Food was uneatable, no refund, boycott this establishment!!!  Drive through is the worst, rude person taking your order, even more rude of a person at the window.  Always have to wait, telling  you to park off to the side (I don't mind doing that, but if I do do it, food better be worth the wait) but you get hour old food, and half cooked fries.  Dave Thomas must be rolling in his grave.  This is the WORST establishment I have ever seen.  Sucks cause I am a local, and don't have much choice in fast food here.  I am now willing to venture further out, just to avoid this place!"
738,"Literally the worst McDonald's I've been to. Ordered the Southwest grilled chicken salad at the drive-thru and they totally left out the sauce! the grilled chicken was hard and overcooked, unlike the other ones I had at different Mcdonalds. And the large diet dr. pepper I got literally tasted like carbonated, bitter water. The supposedly ""Dr. Pepper"" ended up being some sort of unknown liquid that tasted like shit...I guess the soda machine was down just like how their ice cream machine is ""down"" 24/7? lol never going through here again"
739,"Sincerely terrible service, clueless cashiers, and a long wait with lots of idle chatter coming from employees in the back. Hit the McDonalds across the street instead. I made this account and wrote this review while waiting for my food."
740,Spent 16 minutes in the drive through for a small fry and a coke. We asked for our money back at the first window so we could just leave and were refused our money back
741,"I've had some pretty negative experiences with the service of Wendy's restaurants in the past, but this location definitely takes the cake.

Never at any fast food location have I had more problems than at the Wendy's on Second Street Pike in Southampton. In particular, I cannot even count on my fingers how many problems I've had with the drive-thru.

Most of the time, the issue is the staff getting the order wrong. I usually order a double combo with ONLY lettuce and onion - NOTHING else, not even cheese, and I always specifically state this to the person taking my order. Over 90% of the time, there is cheese on my double that I SPECIFICALLY stated I did not want. The staff cannot remember what someone wants on their burger for their own life. It is only made worse by the fact that most of the time you are asked to wait by the door to get your order rather than be given it the normal way - at the drive-thru window, immediately after paying for it (you do get your sodas right away, though). And if they get your order wrong, you have to wait 5-10 minutes for them to get you a replacement. The fact that the food is often dry and tasteless doesn't help matters at all.

It doesn't stop at incorrect orders. One standout experience I've had with Southampton Wendy's was one time where their BRAND NEW Coca-Cola Freestyle machine was broken and they said that the only drink they had was bottled water - which had to be bought separately from combo meals, which themselves were the same price without the soda as they were with it. Bad business practice - in a fast food combo meal, most of the value comes from the soda, and without it, it's almost no different than buying the fries and burger separately.

Probably the only redeeming grace this disaster of a location has is the fact that the manager is often willing to make up for the mistakes her employees frequently make. Unfortunately, apologies and the occasional free menu item can only go so far. There needs to be some serious changes in both the way this place is run and quality of service if I am to return."
742,"Weird tasting nuggets, uncooked fries, rude customer service. Manager lets employees curse about drive through people while just standing there. Will not ever go to this one again!"
743,"This place is horrible! I don't know what has happened over the last few months, but every pizza order I have placed has been wrong! In addition, the staff is very unprofessional and rude when you bring their mistake to their attention! 
I will never order from this place again. If I want Pizza Hut I will just drive to another location. Better yet, I think I'll just go with Papa Johns."
744,"So not one for writing a review of negative nature but it's 2:18am and it says on the sign that it's 24 hours drive through, and if that changed please correct me, but I waited in that drive through for 20min and no one came through, and when I pulled around to leave I saw your employee on the phone by the counter inside. I'd like to know her name and know how this acceptable to the managers at this establishment. I mean I saw her inside and on her cellphone !"
745,"This is the absolute worst Pizza Hut In middle Tennessee. I have had 3 terrible experiences at this location.  Every delivery is 30-40 minutes longer than they say it will be. So it normallly takes an hour and a half to get an order. When you call the store to speak to them about it, no one has a clue what is going on with the orders, and the manager has no clue and are always extremely disrespectful. I called customer care on them the last time, and they said told hey would return a call in 3 days & that did not happen either. I am officially done with this location. Do not come here!!!!"
746,"One of the worst Mcdonalds I've ever been to they need new owners or managers or something. The wait time is terrible and they got my order completely wrong, missing items, cold food, etc. Will NOT be going to location ever again."
747,"My husband and I ordered a big dinner box online to be delivered. We get a call shortly after we place the order that they are out of dinner boxes. I asked the woman on the phone if they could just make everything that comes in the big dinner box and just put it in separate boxes. She had to ask her manager. I then learn that they aren't out of boxes...they are out of pan pizza dough. Pizza Hut....out of pizza dough. I asked her if my card would still be charged since obviously we couldn't get any pizza since THEY HAVE NO DOUGH. She had to ask her manager. They're still charging me and I'll see a refund in 3 days. I mean, wow. First of all, the manager probably should have handled that call - would've made it feel like they actually care about customer service. I almost asked to speak to a manager, but if the manager didn't have enough sense after his or her employee already had to put me on hold twice to take the call him/herself, it probably wouldn't have helped anything at all. We will not be ordering through this location again. Seriously disappointed in this company right now."
748,A/C was not working. Everything was dirty. Poor customer service. Worst McDonald's I have ever seen.
749,Horrible. They have the most incompetent people working there. It takes 15-20 minutes to get your small order and they have to check the receipt 10 times to see what's on it and still manage to mess up the order. Not to mention as soon as I get home I see that they double charged my credit card. Seriously? This place sucks lol
750,Very bad service. We were in line for 30 montes in the drive thru and then the McNuggets had like burned oil. Very bad for health and no one should ever go to this location ever. My son threw up and the next day he had diarrhea. Not pleased at all.
751,"My biscuits and sausage gravy were great.

That's where the positives end. The staff were incredibly rude, the service was slow, and the place was filthy. I was there with a couple of friends - one's food was literally dripping with grease and the other's breakfast sandwiches had mayonnaise on them for some reason. Usually you can count on McDonald's for a decent, cheap meal. This one wasn't worth it."
752,"This pizza hut is a joke,  it seems the employees are only there to play not work and made fun of me on the phone because she made me repeat my phone number 4 times due to not paying attention. She was very rude and acted a though i was interrupting her time.  Let's see if my pizza gets here within the 45 minutes quoted or an hour and a half  like last time. Last chance pizza hut!"
753,"Will never ever eat here again. First off, 1 server and 1 cook for my birthday party of 12 people. Took forever to get orders, drinks, and just service overall. Food came out cold and at different times and just wrong all together. Got there at 7 people were still waiting to get food at 9:45. Really? When we wanted to talk to the manager we got attitude and my girlfriend kept getting cut off by the male manager. I guess because we were black they got scared and called the police. Not 1, not 2, not 3 but 6 police officers show up for a dispute over the bill which never really got resolved. They charged $3 for ever glass of ice we got and $15 just to drink our own liquor that we bought because they are byob. I will never eat, refer, or think of this place ever again and I will make sure everyone that came write a review for the soon to be closed shit house."
754,"I usually love Wendys. Out of the usual fast food group, Wendys is always my top pick.

This particular Wendys, however, has a hard time actually keeping food in stock apparently. If I am going out at midnight for Wendys, I am going to want a frosty. A pretty safe assumption that most people going out that late are going to choose Wendys for the frosty right? So why have the past five times I have gone to this store have they not had frostys for a myriad amount of reasons?

These are the reasons they have not had frostys:
1) The machine is broken
2) We turned the machine off (an hour and half before closing..?)
3) We ran out of mix.

One of the visits they didn't even tell me they didn't have it. They charged me and after I pulled around was just told ""I wasn't supposed to say they are available. Can I give you a junior bacon cheeseburger or double instead?"" Not getting into what ""not available"" means, I don't get a refund? I get a burger that's half the price what I was charged for the ""not available"" frosty.. .WTF?

I don't know what's going on. Apparently frostys are an endangered product which must be protected at all costs from predator customers looking to devour them during all hours of the night. 

I just wanted a damn frosty."
755,"Worst McDonald's I've ever been to. The playground was dirty. We asked if they would wash a table for us, and they just have us a blank look, so we washed them ourselves. The playground itself was all greasy. Also, they didn't give us all of our order, and they didn't care."
756,"Not a single good thing to say about this place. My fiancé went in one time because he couldn't get anyone on the phone. When he got there, all the employees were in the office laughing and not paying attention to customers. The whole time the phones were ringing off the hook with no answers. Lady behind him finally yelled to the employees and one girl came out and acted like she was being inconvenienced and interrupted. Next time we tried to order, we wanted the $10 dinner box but they were out. So we asked for a personal pan pizza and breadsticks. Said they were out of breadsticks so we asked for cinnamon sticks. Surprisingly enough they claimed to be out of those too. Worst part is they still made him buy something else or they wouldn't deliver because the price was below $10."
757,"Super unfriendly staff.  Sat at drive-in speaker (one other car was sitting at pickup window) for 6 minutes before someone took my order.  After I gave it, silence.. silence..4 more minutes of silence before they asked for the order again.  All of this at 3pm in the afternoon.  Do not go to this McDonalds unless you have a LONG time to wait and don't need anyone to do more than mechanically take your order and thrust your food to you."
758,Waiting waiting waiting. A million employees just standing around. Managers look very confused. I hate this McDonald's. It is definitely the worst. Bad in. Bad out. Shitty employees. Bad attitude. If they think they are worth $15 they are crazy. Hope they done spit in my food.
759,horrible staff. always rude. drive thru is a joke. check food because order accuracy does not exist. mcdonalds is a not corporation. the rich own them and hire the most disrespectful no knowledge having people. i bet if we boycott they (all the franchises mcdonald's) will get their act together. but who could resist a big mac. managers have no ethics of what customer service or management is.
760,"Yup same slow service. Its 1030 at night. I don't see the reason for this. If it was breakfast, lunch or dinner I can see being backed up. Its close to my house and just an easy place to run up too. There's nothing else really around that I am wanting to go to. Also the other places are usually closed around here."
761,"Not that pizza hut is very good anyway, but this location can never get deliveries right and cancels your orders after over an hour waiting with no notification. This us the second time to happen. Not only that, they really don't care about it either. Never again"
762,"My brother had ordered at the kiosk and got charged but the order did not go through their screen so they made him pay again and I saw that they charged twice so I went over and told them the problem nicely and the cashier told me that it didn't show up on their screen soo & I told her I had the proof on my phone so she got a manager. This problem has also happened at McDonald's on Kennedy kiosk and the manager there had told me that the kiosk was having problems. So the manager at this location was upset she was very unprofessional when I told her she was hesitant to give me a refund WHEN I HAD RECIPIENTS and showed her why would I be lying when I have proof I also told her that the same situation had happened at the Kennedys location & it must be the kiosk & she rudely said ""OK GO BACK TO KENNEDY THEN"" I was shook at that comment I was going to snap on her for being disrespectful but she's old and she might have a stroke and I wouldn't like for that to happen to her I hope this establishment realizes the kind of manager they have ridiculous this was also my first time coming to this location and will be my last"
763,"Honestly this is pretty much the worst McDonald's of all time.  The drive through is slower than Steak 'n Shake and once you get up to the microphone they take forever to take your order, i honestly can't understand how it's so much worse than other McDonald's.  I would have saved time driving over to Hanley even though this was right on my way.
final wait time: TWENTY FIVE MINUTES for two happy meals and two Big Mac meals, no special requests."
764,They messed up my order twice they said that they were going to deliver and eventually delivered to another address so they messed up i called again AND GOT HUNG UP ON ONCE then finally they answered after calling three times for being on hold they said they were going to send me a free order at the right Address and that was it someone else called me back and said they had cancelled my order and my money will be sent back but they had just said they were going to deliver now I'm left with nothing but disrespect they are unprofessional they are rude and I'm never ordering from there ever again
765,Cold hash browns. This McDonald's ALWAYS has cold hash browns. And the service is by far the worst of all the McDonald's restaurants I've visited in my lifet. I've given this particular McDonald's several chances to redeem themselves and they've managed to fail every time. This place is a joke
766,Watch out for the cockroaches!  I sat down for lunch today and one ran from under the napkin dispenser into the middle of the table. It doesn't look like anyone is taking time to clean under the tables or along the walls.  I can't imagine what the kitchen looks like. I had no plans to try the Sushi and would recommend avoiding the place all together.
767,"Food poisoning extravaganza, with a smile. I write this as I am up with a case of food poisoning at 2:30 am. While the people who work here are courteous and keep inviting you back, there's no mistaking that the food is totally lacking to the point of being unsafe. We ate here a little after 8 pm, and found a very narrow selection of Asian food, including some ready-made sushi and a hibachi grill area which was unattended (so much for that idea). While the sushi rolls looked good, they clearly had been sitting out awhile, as had all the food on the ""hot"" tables, when there was any left (it was clear that most of the trays hadn't been refilled that evening). Overall, one star for nice people, but sadly we won't be seeing them again, as one bout of food poisoning was enough."
768,Cold hash browns. This McDonald's ALWAYS has cold hash browns. And the service is by far the worst of all the McDonald's restaurants I've visited in my lifetime. I've given this particular McDonald's several chances to redeem themselves and they've managed to fail every time.
769,"Online the branch closes at 11pm. At 9:45 pm we were waiting in line at the drive through and by 9:55 pm we finally get to the drive through mic. We wait for 5 min then someone responded, ""we are closed. Just started cleaning."" Mentioned online says they close at 11pm. No response. There was a line of 8 cars waiting and people in the lobby. Figure it out."
770,"Filthiest restaurant I have EVER seen! Not a clean table in the house, broken urinal & fecal matter all over the toilet. Waited almost 15 minutes for a cold big mac on a stale bun. Never again! Only 3 customers in the store with a large staff"
771,"This location just needs to be SHUT DOWN!! It's freaking horrible!!
1. It says it's open 24/7 LIES! 
2. Slow as hell, inside and drive threw. 
3. It's disgusting inside!! It's NEVER CLEAN!!
4. live in the neighborhood and I swear since the mcflurrys came out their machine has been ""down"" BULL!! 
The employees are just lazy and rude! Get your shit together McDonald's!!!"
772,"Horrible service! Fries were cold, and hamburgers were extremely  sloppy and not organzied. I wish I would be able too give a negative star for the ratings. I would not recommend this place to anyone. They want a $15.00 an hour for their service. This is ridiculous, get it together people!"
773,"I usually don't write bad reviews but this really is the worst McDonald's I've ever been to. We lived by this one for 3 years and every single time was a pain. Either they are out of soda, can't accept cards, never come on the intercom to take your order, take 20+ minutes when there are only two cars in the line, etc. The list goes on and on; it's almost laughable how terrible this place its. The owner, if this is a franchise, should be ashamed. If this is a corporate McDonald's, fire every single manager. Other McDonalds around the area are all great - but this one is legitimately terrible."
774,"Just a complete waste of time. No professionalism and by far the worst McDonald's I've ever been. I waited nearly 15 minutes in the drive thru just for 3 other cars to go ahead of me. After I repeatedly said ""hello"" and ""is anyone there"" with no answer. I just drove off at that point (fire your drive thru cashier please). Unfortunately this one is very close to my house and it being late (10:15pm I had no choice but to come here). I am taking my business to the McDonald's on waters ave and Armenia. Where I just had my order taken, paid and given in less than 10 minutes with a line full of cars. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL TIMES!"
775,"Honestly if I could give this Pizza Hut location a negative 5 star rating I would. I called and placed an order for carry out and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. Cool. Went to pick it up and they had no record of me ever ordering a pizza.

They told me that my call had likely been sent to the call center and the call center had most likely sent my pizza to a different location. I called the call center and they have no record of my order either.

The fact is, I recognized the voice of the guy working the counter when I went in. I have no doubt that he ""took"" the order. When I got to be visibly frustrated he told me it was his 2nd day on the job.

Finally I placed another order that was supposed to be ready in 10 minutes. 20 minutes later I had a pizza and some cheese bread I didn't order (I ordered cheese sticks)...

This is the most worthless place. If you work here, do your future a favor and quit. I swear to God this place is like the Twilight Zone. I worried for a moment that I'd walk out the door as I exited with my soggy pizza and unloved, unwanted cheese bread only to find myself in some endless Mobius Strip time loop of Groundhog Day-esque proportions. 

But hey, if you're in the mood for wasting your time and feeling like you've begun to dangerously sprint towards the edge of sanity, then call them up and order your disgusting lipids. Bring the family and ruin their day as well!"
776,If I could give zero stars I would. My steak was completely raw when it came out. My fries were also cold. My daughters meal was cold as well. My steak came back out a half hour later and I was told it was reheated. The prices are way too high for cold gross steak. Half the table never even got food. It took an hour to even order. The manager was rude and treated us bad when we complained about the gross food and horrible service. Don't waste your whole night like I did and still didn't get a dinner.
777,Not at all happy with my delivery order. I received my order on a timely matter but probably because half of my toppings and cheese we're on one side of the pizza and box. Beyond pissed and I left a decent tip to open up both of my boxes of Slop!
778,I'd rate this 0 starts if I could. Recently visited and placed order in drive through. 5 PM on a Sunday. Took over 40 minutes. 40 minutes at a fast food restaurant. Finally got to the window handed the wrong meal. No apology for the wait. Pull out and see nobody in the restaurant but 4 employees standing around. Unbelievable. Whoever owns this should be ashamed and will be sharing with McDonalds HQ.
779,"Would give this place negative stars if I could.  Drive through, even if there is just 2 cars infront of you will be a 30 minute wait.

Soda and icecream machines have been down multiple times

Food is always cold and stale."
780,They decide when they want to deliver and to where.  We live right across the street from them and they told us they didn't deliver to our location and gave us a bogus number to call.  We call back and they put us on hold.  Now I would eat the pizza because I'm scared they would do something nasty to it!  The girl taking the order is to inexperienced!  This place is horrible and I would never refer anyone there.
781,This is the absolute worse place to eat! The food came out cold after we waited over an hour to get it...i asked the manager what was the problem and she was a total bitch to us! She took 2 table orders at the same time and mixed up all the food!! I wouldn't give a bum there food to eat!!!!!!
782,"This is the slowest mcdonalds on the planet! Waited close to 20 minutes just for 2 breakfast sandwiches. Even whenever we got to the window, they still didn't have our order ready!"
783,McDonald's sucks I ordered a milkshake and got a one with green on the bottom and no cherry they always had cherries Idk what happened but they need to change that don't get a milkshake from McDonald's
784,"I've been there 2 separate times -once at 9:30pm and another at 10:15pm - and NOBODY was ever at the drive thru! Hours are until 11pm as far as I can find. One time I waited 5 minutes, said ""hello?"" a few times and nothing. Not sure what's up but definitely crappy service...if you're busy just let the customers know."
785,"I was gonna give them 5 stars except for one little incident. I ordered my pizza around 10 pm. I couldn't have been more tired or hungry. I fell asleep waiting on my pizza but I don't think it took that long, only took 2 hours to deliver it. The guy who delivered my pizza woke me up and honestly I didn't even remember ordering anything. I even asked him if he was sure that it was my pizza. I tipped him $1 and I think because of that, the pizza tasted horrible. That was the worst pizza I've ever had! I threw it outside and on my way to work the next morning I saw at least 10 rats laying on their back flat dead. It didn't take me long to realize that was the result of them eating the pizza I had thrown out. Anyways, I want to thank Pizza Hut for helping the neighborhood get rid of this many rats at once, way to go!"
786,Absolutely disgusting undercooked burger after ordering plain. So gross. I will not go back. This could have caused some serious food poisoning.
787,"This place looked very promising but quickly turned into disaster. The buffet was lacking variety and food. it seemed to take them a long time to replenish. The desserts were meh what could go wrong with frozen cakes?? RIGHT.With all this I could have gotten past (maybe) but my disaster was the service. The waitress never came back we had to hail her every time she brought a large glass of sprite for my granddaughter (who is 3) without a lid so I ask if she could put it in a child cup no problem. Then about 15min later I ask her for the drink ""oh yeah, I will be right back"" another 10 mins I ask again and finally got her drink yes she took the original drink back. My husband ask for a refill 3 times and never got it. Needless to say we left a note on the bill saying ""we tip according to service and since we didn't get any neither do you."" THIS is a FIRST for us we always tip and well."
788,I have eaten here before and it's always decent but I ordered two medium two topping pizzas that were a special and both have barely any sauce on them. The cheese was very salty too. I couldn't even finish the pizza I got for myself. Not only did they talk crap about me and my request when I came back for a refund but Lisa tried to tell me we ate 1/2 of each pizza when we had each eaten a slice and tried to eat a second and just couldn't stomach it. They were all incredibly rude except for James Bagsby. I will NEVER eat here again!
789,"I placed a mobile order for two breakfast sandwiches, and arrived at the drive-thru at 6:17 am (Saturday). The employee informed me that she was still preparing to open and it would be another 15 minutes. While I waited, about four other drivers were told the same. At 6:33, she told me again it would be 15 minutes; I continued to wait in my car at the speaker. 3 or 4 other cars were subsequently told 15 minutes at the second speaker. At 6:51 a customer at the second speaker placed an order and drove to window one to complete his order. After two minutes of silence, I drove to window one, the same employee asked me if I had already ordered. I began with yes, and continued to explain that I had been one of the earlier customers waiting, when she eagerly interjected to explain that ""this is window one...that's window two...you need to drive up to pick up your food"".

I drove to window two, knowing I would need to explain to someone else. When I arrived there and began to let the second person know, I began to hear the original employee yell from the rear of the restaurant ""...well, he didn't tell me he had a mobile order...he should have said something"". She then walked up to the window and said they had no record of my mobile order (FK55), and asked me if I still wanted the items. I commented that I would prefer not to have to pay twice, and she informed me that ""you will have to contact the credit card company to get the first refund"".  I was generous with my time, and apparently with my money. The employee was neither courteous nor helpful. I drove to the Hanley McDonald's location, where they were a bit backed up due to construction, but prepared my order rather quickly, and were considerably kind in asking me if I had everything I needed. 

Hampton Avenue McDonald's continues to be a poor customer service experience for me."
790,I have never seen such long slow line for drive thru. Tired of waiting went in for coffee had $10 and a $1 came to 1.10. Daughter had left change in car.  Rather than breaking a 10 the employee. Said I will wait for you to go get a dime from your car.  I think I'll pass on this McDonald's
791,"First time going to try Granny's Buffet and I will never go back. I always try to go to mom and pop stores/restaurants to try to help and give back to the community so we figured we would try them out.
It was Terrible! I was shocked at how we had to pay before we even sat down, and even worse they wanted to know if I wanted to put my tip on my card then. How do I know if I want to tip them if I haven't even sat down yet? Then she made a huge deal about what soda we wanted and we had to decide then as well. Once I get to my table I realize she made a huge deal about what I wanted to drink, but didn't give me a drink. Only for my waitress to come over to take my drink order. Really??
It smelt like old food and reminded me of a nursing home. Once we got up to go and get food, I couldn't decide what I wanted because none of it looked appetizing to me. I picked some baked chicken and french fries, only to find out once I sat down the chicken was dripping with fat and oil and my fries were soggy and cold.
After my first small plate of food I just decided to skip trying to eat anything else and would just go right to dessert. I went to get ice cream and the ice cream scoop was sitting in old dirty water, i found a napkin and tried to clean it off the best I could before using it. Then the hard part was deciding what ice cream to pick because there were so many empty containers and half of the full ones had other ice creams mixed in with them and toppings from the topping bar in them. GROSS!
Myself and my sister were so grossed out and disappointed by our trip there that we will never return and I will never recommend Granny's to anyone.
Also they should update the decor from the Chinese restaurant that was there before them."
792,"If I could give no stars I would. One employee wanted to throw down over an iced coffee mistake. Asked for ""back iced coffee"" and first received a coffee with sugar and milk, then received a coffee with sugar. She yelled at my sister over it. You could see the pumps of sweetener distinctively separate from the coffee... mind you, we waited 20 mins for four breakfast sandwiches while workers stood around doing nothing. Will avoid this store."
793,"Worst McDonald's I've ever been to. Do Not Go Here! Wish I could give 0 stars or even negative. Looks nice on the outside and good area. But crappy service, takes forever, people are rude. This is the only time I have ever written a review in my life. I usually think it's a waste of time but I had to say don't ever go here"
794,Please please please do better. The location is fire but for some reason this place sucks. Literally have tried over and over and never once have I gotten good service or good food. How is that even possible?
795,They have a 11 year old working the register. I waited in line for over 15 minutes after paying for my order. They then flagged down the 11 year old so I couldn't get my order corrected. The management here is ridiculous. How hard is it to serve a burger and fries? I guess very hard when you're 11 years old...
796,Not real sure why they're open. They have no Co2 so no fountain drinks. No sweet tea. No salads. The cashier is incredibly friendly but I had to wait to place my order while she went and got change for the customer in front of me because she had no one. And I have been waiting for 15 minutes to pick up my food. There is zero organization or leadership apparent and I would have gotten a refund a left but it's not worth disappointing the kids and wasting more time going somewhere else.
797,Supposed to be open 24/7 but they just told me they were closed after serving the car in front of me.
798,"This McDonald's has one thing going for them: consistency. They are consistently terrible. I've never been one to review fast food, but it's actually amazing how bad every visit has been to this place. It's the closest one to where I live, so it's disappointing that it's actually the worst location I've ever experienced in my life. Drive thru takes at least 15-20 mins on a slow day (don't bother during lunch). Not only slow, but rude service every time. Very troubling that this is located near such a busy intersection, but I will now travel out of my way for McDonald's just to avoid this mess."
799,Stopped on our way home from a Blues game. We were informed they wouldn't be able to take any orders for at least 15 minutes because they were in the middle of a shift change. Seriously?
800,Consistently closed WAY earlier than posted hours. Honestly not going to even check anymore.
801,This is the worst McDonald's I've ever had the miss fortune of coming too. The staff are consistently rude and are not interested in doing anything to help anyone and I've never seen management act as lackadaisical this management does.  Furthermore they routinely close 15-20 minutes before the advertised time and don't care.  Avoid this one and go to Hanley Road where you'll have a chance!
802,Came here at 12:30 AM on 11/24 and I have never had worse service from a place anywhere in my life. the lady in the drive thru was exceedingly rude when I was just asking questions about the menu. I see why this place has as low of stars as it does. Do better.
803,"Another one star review. What a surprise.

I don't know how many times we've been here, maybe about 6 or 7 times. 

Each and every time we've had shitty service and bad food. I don't think I've ever had fresh french fries there. Each and every time they've been soggy. If I had to hesitate a guess it would be that they scoop the fries that are getting older out of the bin into the containers and putting them aside before they dump the new batch in that then sits there until the old, packed containers go out, repeat. 

Same thing with the burgers. I'm not making it up, half the time I've been there I've had dry, stale burgers buns, twice to the point where they were inedible. I mean hard and stale. I don't know what's so difficult about pulling buns out of package, processing them, making burgers, and sending them across the chute. 

Then! To top it off, you can't order anything special order. It just gets messed up. ""McDouble, no ketchup, no mustard, add lettuce."" That's it. Never have they gotten that correct. 

Lastly, I go there normally around peak time. So it's not 1/2 before they close, it's not dead of the afternoon when they hardly have any drive-thrus going through. 

There's a reason for the lack of cars at the drive thru. There's a reason this location pretty much only gets one star from everybody.

Just pick another location."
804,It's nasty. Nothing I got form the jerk chicken to Mac and cheese to yams was cooked right.Doesn't even taste like Jamaican food. It's honestly so bad it should be a crime and they need to shut down and do some cooking training but I'll settle for this review where I tell you never to order from here because if you've eaten Jamaican food from anywhere else you will be disgusted.
805,"Literally the worst. 5 cars in front of me and waited 40 minutes to get my food. I would have easily backed out if I could have. No one at the cash window to pay, so I had to wait for someone to show up. Orders are cold and wrong. Don't come here."
806,"I have not written a lot of yelp reviews, but I felt as if I owed it to the world to take time out of my day to write this. How in God's name is your ice cream machine being cleaned during shamrock shake season? How does it take 8 minutes in the drive through to provide luke warm soggy fries? Ronald McDonald would be ashamed, and the employees should be too."
807,"Order was placed at 12:57, and was due to arrive at 1:40. At 1:54 I called to check on it, and was told we were next up and about 10 - 15 minutes. 30 minutes later I called again, and was given the excuse only 1 delivery guy. The ""mngr"" kept interrupting, not letting me speak, and when I asked her what time she received my order, she said 1:13. I kept asking why she didn't let the customer know then it was going to be late, and she never would give me an answer. When asked for her managers name, number and email, she refused to give it to me. I canceled my order at 2:33, almost an hour after our order was supposed to arrive. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!"
808,"This McDonald's is utterly terrible with its bad customer service, terrible management, and has messed up my order too many times to count. I would not recommend ever coming to this establishment, even with the better interior decorations and seating arrangement. The staff is always arguing and they are not cooperative to get my order correct when I notify them a mistake has occurred. The manager has an attitude with customers who try to gain his attention. He was even screaming at an employee while I was waiting for my food to be completed. I wish some improvements would be made before this establishment closes due to poor management and training."
809,couldn't even get our all of our order. also the lady that bright it out to us was very rude. Also the orange juice was warm. Very very very slow!
810,"Multiple times ""closing"" before their hours, turning off their lights with me in the drive thru just now. Forgetting to turn off their headsets and talking abut customers. I know it's just mcdonalds, but come on guys."
811,"Absolutely the worst piece of trash pizza hut that I have ever encountered. They made me wait over an hour just for me to be told that my food was delivered to the wrong address. The manager's name who she was Chelsea, although I don't believe her, told me that they couldn't get in contact with the driver. The I asked for her corporate number she told me ""they don't have a corporate number"" This is what happens when you have stupid people in charge of a business. DO NOT EAT HERE! They need to be shut or find better people to run that place!!!"
812,This McDonald's had the worst customer service I have ever experienced! The manager was very rude and refused to make more de cafe coffee at 8:30pm when they close at 11pm and they didn't have any orange juice so they just gave us a kids apple juice instead. We came for the play place but it was locked so we tried asking when it opened and the manager rudely told us that it closed at 8pm.
813,"I would love to know when Wendy's decided to close at 10p on a Saturday . I waited at drive thru for a few minutes before pulling around to be told they were closed as a worker chomped down on some chicken nuggets. I was asked if I wanted to order anything after asking if they are opened and they confirmed they closed at 10p but were thinking of opening until 1030p. 
Well, asshole- I'm not going to order anything if you are closed. Additionally, it Is probably not good business to suggest for me to go across the street to McDonald's, which is a competitor. Lastly, that is what we did and got a great meal. This Wendy's is a disappointment.  I started off working in fast food as a youngster and this place is abysmal. The service is awful and if I wanted to deal with ghetto rude people, I would order in Camden. Do not waste your time at this establishment."
814,The food was cold and the service was terrible. There is way way they are following basic food safety at this location
815,"Terrible. McDonald's founder would roll in his grave if he got the service that we got today. I feel sorry for the people living in the neighboring area if this McDonald's is their only for their source Since there is no grocery store nearby. It seems like there are many pedestrians that live in the neighborhood.
The people working in this McDonald's should be grateful that they have a job in this day and age with COVID-19. We got the wrong drinks we almost pulled away with having half of our order. And then when we asked about the order we got nothing but rude smart talk. I don't even want to think about what they do to your food behind the doors.  Sad and Awful"
816,Oh sis most definitely not . I ordered a $40 order through door dash and then the people get here and this is far from what I got on top of that it's cold asf . Y'all needa get it together this is not the move
817,"I have never been so disgusted in a pizza restaurants customer service in my entire life.  I ordered a pizza Sunday evening online and asked for contactless delivery and didn't put the tip on my card.  I had cash I was going to leave in the door before the delivery driver got there.  But the funny part is I had someone call me from Pizza Hut before my food got to me asking how I was going to tip.  I've never had someone call me and ask me for a tip before. And it gets better. My food is delivered by a big oaf of a woman who comes to my door and rings the bell and straight up asks me how I'm going to tip.  At this point I'm already annoyed by the phone call and I ask her for a receipt and a pen and tell her I'll just sign for a tip and she tells me she doesn't have either of those.  Needless to say I told her I guess you're not getting a tip then.  She proceeds to ""pssh"" me and storm off of my front porch.  During these times in COVID I have been tipping all food service workers significantly more than usual to give support.  But I do not appreciate people trying to bully me into giving them money.  I'll do things my own way as a paying customer.  This Pizza Hut just lost a customer for sure."
818,"I ordered online and wanted curbside pick up. After giving it some time, I went down to the store. I texted the number in the window and answered the question about my name and my car. I received a text saying we'll be with you shortly...but I waited. I waited and waited while I saw the three visible employees all ON THIER PHONES. One even decided to stand by the windows where everyone could see him, as I was not the only person waiting. I waited some more, then about this time an employee came out the side of the building (?) no pizza in hand, and motioned for the young man to come and follow them (?) I didn't know what was going on but I didn't have a good feeling and I had had enough. At this point it had been thirty minutes since I placed my order. I went inside (remember I ordered curbside, but I had to get out of my car anyway) and the guy standing by the windows in front said to me that he would get somebody to take my order. At this point a woman walked up as I was saying I had already ordered online. I told them my name and my pizza and cinnamon rolls were in the WARMER. I told them I had already paid online, wished them a good night, and got back in my car. As soon as I was pulling out of the parking spot, I noticed that young man from earlier getting back into his car and pulling out as well. When I got home I could tell that this pizza wasn't even fresh. So that was my experience and I don't care if I have to drive to Lebanon Pike, don't plan on coming back to this Pizza Hut again."
819,"I recently move to the Antioch area last June. I order pizza on the regular from a lot of places !! But this Pizza Hut right here is a HEADACHE!!! Let's start with my last year experience I ordered a beef pizza when it arrived it had pepperoni!! I called had them deliver another that pizza was then RAW, uncooked , & doughy !!! So I went to the store manger never offered a refund NOTHING !!!! Made another pizza yet again doughy at this point I said forget it! So today I decided to order a pizza I'm like heck that was almost a year ago ! I got the big pizza box !! I should've known when the delivery guy handed me the box and it was wet that some was WRONG!!! Opened the boxes cheese is stuck to the top !! Pizza is doughy !!! Break sticks weren't even cooked let alone DONE!! Called spoke with manger SISCO ! RUDE just said ""I'll send another out"" didn't ask for number name NOTHING!!!im honestly sick of it and after reading the reviews about this place it honestly needs to be closed or be under new management !! I was told I will receive a refund but yeah we'll see! Oh and the marinara sauce for my breadsticks were freezing cold"
820,"Do not bother with McDonald's in general.  All of their chains are disgusting, this one is the worst.  I don't know how this restaurant chain is still in business!  This particular location is the worst.  You have to order an extra piece of cheese on the filet of fish to get any on the actual sandwich.  You have to order extra sauce on a big mac to get any sauce at all.  The soda is always flat.  And if you want a mcflurry good luck.  Their machine is always down.  Never order any type of iced tea from McDonald's cause they put it in a stainless steel container that they obviously never wash.  I guess their employees don't realize that tea spoils and you can taste the mildew buildup.  Disgusting.  Let's not even get started on customer service.  There is NONE!  Management is just as bad.  Why would you employee people and pay them for being annoyed by their customers?  I felt like I was an inconvenience and bothering them.  I was as polite as possible and said thank you. None in return.  So thank you McDonald's, will never be returning to your chain crap food again!"
821,"ABSOLUTELY THE WORST PIZZA HUT EVER! 
4/13/19 VISIT -Order:2 pastas and Cinamon rolls
 I placed an order and waited in the drive through, came in several times in to the store front and not once was I greeted or did anybody come to the front until about an 1 hr and 15 minutes after waiting. After 1 hour and 35 minutes my order was ready. Get this, the pastas I ordered had no sauce on them! NO SAUCE!!! It was plain pasta with sprinkled cheese on it. I walked out with an order of cinnamon buns for a family dinner of four.

4/25 VISIT -Order:2 pastas
 When I came to pick up the order the employee stated they had confused my meaty marinara pasta with a meaty pzone. She offered to remake the pasta or I could take the order as it was. My kids where starving and I decided to take the pzone.

5/3 VISIT -Order: 2 pzones 
Picked up my order and made the mistake of not checking my order before leaving. Came home and I open up one NOT fully cooked pzone!!!!!!!!!! Called to request a refund and I'm told by the manager Adrien that he can either remake it or issue a credit but he CAN NOT do refunds on cards.On top of that he called me a liar for saying it wasn't fully cooked (see picture attached). My receipt clearly states no refunds after 7 days. I requested a refund less than 30 minutes after I paid for the order.

I work in the customer service field and I'm very patient and empathetic but the bad service at this specific establishment is absolutely ridiculous and unprofessional and corporate needs to intervene immediately! 

I will be calling my bank to dispute the charge and I will be calling corporate to file a formal complaint.

Update: Called corporate to file a complaint and I'm waiting to speak to the regional manager."
822,"I wish there was a ""No star"" review ""!!! This site is THE ABSOLUTE WORST on customer service!! I called the store manager to report her driver was a half hour late, and she was the rudest B&$@# I've ever talked to!!! They lost a great customer and she's very lucky that I don't come up there and make her ass famous on Worldstar!!!"
823,"I think everyone who works at this Pizza Hut is high on some sort of drugs . They have horrible customer service . That should have been my cue to order elsewhere , but I decided to give them a chance . I ordered a large pizza with just cheese and a tomato dipping sauce  on the side . They delivered me a pizza with pepperoni and pineapples and they forgot my sauce . Called back , the girl was rude AGAIN and said they would bring back another pizza . I politely reminded her if they can remember the sauce . She rudely answers "" Only If you paid for it the first time . "" They bring another pizza . It was not cooked all the way AND they forgot my freaking sauce . I'm done with this place . The first time I moved to Antioch the pizza sucked here too . I'm glad I'm moving back to Murfreesboro . Antioch sucks and this Pizza Hut sucks . They should just go out of business ."
824,"Horrible experience

I couldn't believe it. They gave me the wrong order and when I called to complain about it, they hung up on me

I ordered Happy meal for kid (6 pieces of chicken nuggets - apple juice). I had been waiting for 15 mins to get my order and they gave me the wrong one (I didn't know about it because I have never ordered it before) do I took the order and drove home. They just gave me the bag with burger and water.. WTH.... it was at 7 pm yesterday ( I don't know how many workers worked at that time but for sure the guy was responsible for answering the phone should be training again about treating the customer.

I won't be back again for that place with the horrible service like that"
825,This place is flooded with incompetent workers. You can expect wrong orders here every time you visit. The drive thru at night won't have any food ever. And the workers will purposely avoid taking your order at night so they don't have to work. My god this is the worst McDonald's on the West Bank. Good bye
826,"One of my most annoying drive thru experiences. They had me pull forward to wait for fries, and basically forgot about me. I was waiting 10 minutes and when I went in my bags were already filled just sitting there. My food got cold waiting on them"
827,"I would not even give a star if at all possible.  I showed up with only  two people in line with tickets or receipts.  The type of people that are working here this particular day were careless, non intentional, and lack of motivation. There was no manager to  speak of, and no was trying to serve me to get me out of there.  People were outside smoking instead of working.   McDonalds should be completely embarrassed  by this locations service."
828,The last few times I came here have been horrible and after this time I just wont be back. The customer service is lacking to say the very least. The entire order was not only wrong but the food taste like it's been sitting there for hours on end. I live down the block but this is the last time I will ever visit this McDonald's. They are going to give someone food poison.
829,They have the worst staff I have encountered. They lie about times and the food. The service is horrible. I hope someone comes in and changes the staff because it's horrible.
830,Will literally just throw anything in the bag regardless of what you ordered. Apple pie? Nope here's a strawberry cream pie or just no pie at all. Ordered sauce with your nuggets? Too bad.
831,"Drive thru messed up
Our order did not give us straws for
Our drinks. Had to go in and tell them
They Messed up our order. We had our receipt but that was not good enough they wanted the bag
Of food. So out came
My daughter to bring in the bag of
Food so they could see that it was not what we ordered and then they gave us our straws and our 2 cheeseburgers. 
Don't waste your time here"
832,"I know I keep telling myself with new employees this place will be better, but it won't. The workers have no leader or anyone to show them how to do their job. Or teach them how to wear gloves, how to not touch their hair then then other surfaces or places where food is, to go bags, cups, lids, etc. The GM is friendly and can only do so much, but his woman assistant manager is awful. She uses foul language, she is rude when you have a issue with the food she's serving. She gives me raw fries, tells me she pulled them out of the fryer when it says to and the reason the fries are real light is because they just changed the oil. They may have just changed the oil,  but was the fryer at the right temp?? If you know the oil isn't hot enough for the fries to be cooked correctly, then you need to leave them in longer since the temp wasn't right, or change the fryer later when slow....come on this isn't rocket science. I  know what fries from McDonald's are supposed to be like. Not to mention all the young girls in there are definitely not friendly and dont belong in customer service. This place needs corporate help big time, and workers who work, not half ass everything and just talk and play around. Its time for the corporate people to do something!!"
833,"Not even worth a star!! They want $15/hr my ass! They asked repeatedly asked what the order was. Our order wasn't even complicated. Then we get to the window to pay. The manager or girl at the window is telling two other employees what they should be doing, but in an unprofessional way.  Get to the second window, girl goes, what did you order!? The heck?!! You should know! You should have had that drink going before we got there and the bag of food ready to give to us. They weren't even slammed!  Never going back here again!
They need a lot of help!"
834,"I've been in this drive-through line for no less than 20 minutes and I still haven't been able to give my order. I have never seen a McDonald's this slow and disoriented. I've been going to McDonald's since the creation of McDonald's...  LOL. This place is an embarrassment. At some point if you can't represent your brand correctly, you should close the location, or send corporate out to fix the location so that it represents the same standard McDonald's tries to produce all of its locations. What a disappointment, when I finally get my food, it will be 40 minutes.  Fast food?  Really?  How about SLOW food!!!"
835,This Pizza Hut is absolutely terrible when it comes to customer service. They've made my wrong 3 times. I simply requested light sauce and I don't know who makes the pizzas but they continue to put extra sauce. If you can see the sauce through the cheese ITS TOO MUCH SAUCE in my opinion. I called them to ask why my order is made wrong all the time the manager of the store decided to speak but would not listen to me. So I got angry and yelled. It turned into a screaming match over the phone. I called their corporate office and reported the manager for flat out disrespectful behavior. I won't be ordering from them again. Trust me
836,"I just ordered from this Pizza Hut. I received my first pizza in a timely manner. 

As soon as I open the pizza and fix my plate,a piece a hair was on my arm. I pulled the hair and it was ACTUALLY in the PIZZA. A piece of hair was baked in my pizza. 

I called Pizza Hut and the manager Lisa tells me she will send me a whole new order but I need to return the hairy pizza. No problem. I return EVERYTHING,my extra PAID sauces and all to get a dry ass pizza,cheese sticks with no sauce, no icing for the cinnamon sticks,no extra garlic like I paid!!! 

You guys are straight TRASH. Why would you send me a whole new order with no sauces???? You tell me to pack everything up,I do & you leave out my sauces. The piece of hair wasn't enough???? Y'all ruined my entire night waiting for a crap dinner."
837,"Don't order ice cream from here, I ordered two vanilla cones in a cup and they barely put any ice cream in the cup!! I've gotten it like that before at other locations and they give you a pretty decent amount .   It here!! 
I give it NO STARS!!!!!! ( it doesn't let u post unless you rate)"
838,"Definitely never ordering from this location anymore, recommend to ""Always check your pizza at the store when picking up"" as the mess up a lot

my wife placed an order online for a super supreme pizza, when i arrived home she told me they where missing ingredients, I called to complain about the mistake they made of forgetting the ingredients and was forwarded to the talked to the manager, when i asked her name she didn't say it clearly but did identify herself as the manager, told her about the mistake and how would they correct it, was thinking to have one of her drivers deliver the pizza properly done with correct ingredients and their driver could pickup the wrong pizza but she was rude and unprofessional, said she won't send nobody and I had to drive back to return to the store to drop the wrong pizza and she would give me a new one, i told her i live 15min away and would not go as I don't have time but she said only way to replace my pizza or refund was for me to drive all the way back to the store and return the pizza to her or else she won't do anything. I submitted a complaint with pizza hut corporate because of her rude attitude unprofessional, I know they have cameras internally in the store to review the video of the toppings they used and all calls are recorded so they can look up the recording of the call i had with her, i took a picture of the pizza with the receipt on top as backup and you can clearly see it doesn't have all the ingredients we ordered and the border was barely parmesean crust and the dough was flat as they didn't let it raise properly.

This is not the first time the mess up an order, but because of her attitude definitely the last time i place an order in this store"
839,"DISGUSTING. The floor is covered in spilled stains, the smell of this place is revolting.

Went in to use the Wi-Fi and had to leave."
840,"This had to be the worst Big Mac I have ever had. I took two bites and threw it out. 

I can tell the meat was sitting around for some time until I came"
841,"Don't order curbside. Apparently they don't like to walk outside. I waited for 30 minutes and finally had to go through the drive thru (dining room was closed) and wait another 10 minutes to get my food. When I told them that I've been waiting for over 30 minutes I didn't even get an apology. I know good help is hard to find, but this is ridiculous. If you'd don't want to deliver curbside, then don't offer it."
842,"If I could give negative stars I would. First thing, I have a big order so I try and go through the drive thru. Well they tell me it's not working and to come inside. So I said okay no problem. I get inside and let them know I have sorta a big order. I order my food, she reads it back to me, I pay it's all good. She hands me 4 cups without a drink carrier like I can haul all 4 and my food out to my car by myself lol then I get my food and realize I'm missing half my order. I went back in, told them I'm missing my chip and cheese and two soft shell tacos with no lettuce. They give me my food again and I leave and I check my food and they literally give me two tacos with lettuce. I don't know why these people are so miserable to try and make everyone else's days so miserable but damn go get a diff job if you don't like where you work. Screw this location for real."
843,Yuck. Burger terrible. Chicken sandwich terrible. Fries weird. Slow service. Taco Johns and Checkers must be exchanging the crap workers they hire back and forth between the two because neither place can get their shit together.
844,"Power was out at a majority of places, so I won't hold the 20minute plus wait against them, HOWEVER,  I ordered wings and specifically told the lady crispy with xtra sauce...I get a pitiful display of half covered (literally) soggy ass wings. Food and cust service soso at best...then she didnt put any napkins in the bag either. I most likely wont be back. Checkers, do better."
845,"If I could give it less than one star I would!
This is absolutely disgusting!!! A broken acrylic nail in my food! This is unsanitary and nauseating. This location is by far the worst I have ever been to, the service is terrible, the drive through line takes 30 minutes to get through, and now fingernails in my food????"
846,"We had to get together the NJ MVC but decided to stop for a bite to eat and hot tea beforehand. 
First, at the drive thru a car was parked and  partly blocking left lane so all cars were in the right lane. We managed to get thru the left lane.  Second, wanted breakfast but the regular menu was posted, it was 11:00 on the dot. At speaker, we ordered hot tea (never asked about cream or sugar) and double cheeseburger, but we're told literally only 3 items were available: Hot cakes, muffins, & burritos. We ordered 3 burritos and mild sauce pkts (which we never got). Third, we drove to the pay window. The bill was $10 even. We were confused cause total seemed a little high so we asked about price of burritos. Guy at window was vague, evasive & tried to be funny, but we gave him money and asked for receipt, which he was reluctant to do. Burritos were not listed on receipt but  ""3 apple fritters, special order"" were.  Finding this very strange we inquired why burritos were not identified and were told they ""we not listed in the machine"".  Now, being 61, and my driver/niece 49 we knew better and our suspicions rose. Having worked at McDonald's, my niece figured someone was either commiting fraud or stealing the fritters (which are more heavily inventoried then burritos apparently) thus charged them instead of the burritos. At the second window we were told to ""go to the 3rd window"" with no explanation. Turned out to the entrance! We then drove back around the bldg to 2nd window. Now we were told our ""food was to be brought to us"". Still waiting on our food at the window and being quite frustrated, we got into a brief verbal dispute with the window worker and food prep person but finally got our food. All I can say is it was a lost unpleasant experience. BTW: they took it upon themselves to round our bill up to $10 by 3 cents to RMHC (Ronald McDonald House Charity,) without asking. Had they asked we may have donated more. Just saying."
847,Drive through line is always incredibly long and they are slow. Sign outside says lobby open 7am-7pm when it is locked every time.
848,"Don't bother. Today was my third attempt to give this new business a chance. I have yet to actually eat their food. I waited thru three songs on the radio, and decided if ten minutes wasn't long enough to take my order, they didn't want my patronage."
849,This McDonald's location deserves zero stars.  Over the course of numerous visits I have never had a remotely enjoyable experience here.  The staff is often rude and lazy.
850,"Well I wish I could say something good but I can't you just don't get any customer service here, they have trouble filling an order for oatmeal in the morning just 15 minutes into the work day and they are already having service issues.
Try another location"
851,"My third order and I so disappointed. Just because the city shut down there's no reason to lower your standards. Two barbecue chicken platters was trash. The sides were fine. The chicken was old, rubbery skin smothered in barbecue sauce. I'm done. The photo is the trash bag of the old chicken. The chicken is so old it should have arrived with birthday cake."
852,"I swear the manager there is so rude and if you're gonna be that rude to customers who call to let you know how they're missing items, like it's my fault that it happened and your ""new"" employees can't read an order or grill slip, then maybe you should quit!! I've got 20 years  in the food industry (30 yrs overall working) and this place is so lacking in basic skills of serving the customer. I want what I pay for and a formal complaint has been given."
853,"Charged twice for a meal I never ordered. Tried to get them to fix it, but it is has taken to much effort on my part, so giving up."
854,Very very poor food quality. We came through drive thru yesterday day and very slow. Cashier was in a rude moody attitude. Today we did mobile order here they messed our order up so bad. Do not recommend at all.
855,"I ordered last night through Grubhub. The driver was on time and professional. I have no problem with the driver at all. The food itself was not good. The taste I'd rate a 3/5 which isn't the reason for my review either. It was the quality! For basically a goat stew over rice and beans, this restuarant turned it into the crunchiest meal ever. The goat meat comes with bones as expected, but then they decided to add these stems from some plant that I could assume help them season the meal. These stems defining stand out from the meat as it feels like you are chewing on a literal vine too tough to be consumed with the dish. To top this off, the rice was half cooked with hardened pieces of rice standing out from the soft bunch. Leaving me cautiously eating this meal for any bone, stem, or rice shard. More of a hazard than a meal at this point. I've ordered from this restaurant before but have mainly stuck with the jerk chicken. This dish has me reluctant to try anything else this restaurant has to offer in the future."
856,"Went there to pick up Uber eats order. Called and asked if I could get it without waiting they said no. Got in line 10 minutes later the line hasn't moved I'm 5 cars back. How's this possible? 5 minutes later I call no answer no movement. I cancel pull around and no one even made it past the pay window, who knows wth was going on there. SMH. Hope they enjoyed the 2 bundle boxes that went to waste. Horrible."
857,"To the manager.   To the owner of this franchise.     Customer service is your paycheck.  If your employees by their very manner and behaviors drive your business away.  You are the one who lose at the bottom line.    It is sad that at the drive thru the eye roll of the employee can not only be heard but felt.     

It is July.  July is the month for iced drinks from coffees to smoothies t ice creams.    Why I'm the world would you not have those machines cleaned and ready for use at the start of each shift.     

The lack of everything that insures a business is successful is lacking and apparent.     When a person arrives in the morning.  To the last one to pull up at night the experience should be a good one.   

The outside of your business at night is the employees with pants sagging sitting on the side walk smoking hanging out with friends.  The inside more friends of the employees hanging out.  

I am sorry I know it is cultural.  But this is a place of business while I am enjoying my burger I don't want to see an employees ass.    The fact that this is permitted and there is little to no adult supervision that has been trained in how to manage a shift is obvious.     In a time when the corona virus has left so many businesses on the verge of closing for good.  One would think you would step up your game.    But instead it is a health hazard."
858,"consistently the worst fast food place ive ever been to, i don't know why i try again every few weeks. They will straight up just tell you to leave 75 percent of the time."
859,"I would love to give this store a better rating, as the food if you get it is what you expect from Pizza Hut, and even my own experience there has been varied.  However after my last attempt of an order I cannot leave any type of positive review.  And I do mean an attempt at an order.
  Both my friend and I have tried reaching out to direct management about the fact our order was canceled without us ever being notified.  By the time we realized nothing was seemed to be coming for our delivery, they refused to pick up the phone long enough to do anything other than say store is closed then hang up or hit the hold button.  We called a good 10-15 times.  There was no email, no missed calls, no actual attempt to tell us what was going on.  Only after I started calling corporate did I figure out that they in fact canceled my order (it had been refunded back to my bank).  
  My friend has tried for three days to get the store manager (we were told ""Tiffany"") but alas, there has been no call back.  That night we had two other pizza places we tried to order from, they both had other issues but managed to call us and provide some semblance of customer service (if not our actual food) it was only Pizza Hut that failed at every point.  
  So if you don't want Delivery or aren't ordering at a ""peak""/near closing time then you might be fine but remember if you have a problem that you'll be screaming into a void or at the corporate customer service because this local store just doesn't care.   And this is only the most recent of these types of events, this has happened to me before at least a year ago with almost the same results and being part of the reason I stopped going to Pizza Hut at all."
860,"HORRIBLE & RUDE day manager today!!!  I will never visit this McDonalds again, as long as she works there!!!   She refused to ""open"" the packets of sugar for my & my friends' coffee (since I was in drive thru & I asked her to put my sugar & cream in the cup).  I'm in a compact car.  (I always have the other girls do it and they never complain.). She explained that the sugar dispenser is broken & she said ""I'm not doing it.""   She was very rude about it & was laughing with the other workers.  Her name is GRENADA.  Well, thanks but no thanks, to her.  She is horrible for business.  Most all the other girls are always nice & helpful, but now she's teaching them to be rude.  She was just saying NO to be rude & to deny good service.   She made sure to be ugly about it.  Well after that, my friend was so upset that she dumped her coffee in her lap while trying to add the sugar in the car.   I will be contacting upper management concerning this."
861,"We put in an order around 5:50 pm for delivery for 7:15 pm as that is when we would be home from picking up my stepdaughter. My husband who placed the order got a text around 6:15 pm that our order was out for delivery. We only live around 10 minutes from the store meaning it would be delivered almost an hour early. We got home and picked our food up off the cement floor of the porch rather than the railing and being it inside. The bottom box of pizza had ants all over it which when set on the counter before we realized it, got the ants all over the counter and when opening the box to check out the pizza there were ants in the box as well. We had to throw the whole pizza out. My husband called the store to make a complaint (not for free food or anything but just to make it known) and the lady who answered the phone replied with the time is not guaranteed. When asked then why is it an option she responded well you chose contactless delivery, which is true, but what does that have to do with time and what would have happened had we chose contact? What would have been the protocol then? My husband asked to speak to a manager was put on hold for 30 minutes so he tried calling from my phone, the same woman immediately answered and my husband asked to speak to a manager, the lady out him on hold on my phone and hung up on him in his phone. So my husband drove to the store. As soon as he walked in he again made it known he was not asking for free food or anything of the sort but simply looking for answers and only drove there after being treated poorly by the lady who answered the phone twice. The manager at the store basically brushed him off and said the same thing the employee did. Which none of it makes sense. Don't offer a time if it won't be honored and contactless delivery or not has nothing to do with the time of delivery. This store has horrible customer service and lost a customer, not that it matters to a big corporation anyway."
862,Wish I could give negative stars. Pitiful excuse for a McDonald's. Waited 30 minutes in the drive thru at 5 o'clock on a Saturday and neither of the workers at the window even thought about apologizing and didn't even say a single word to me at that. I finally get my food and realize they forgot one of my burgers. So I go inside to address the situation and end up waiting another 15 minutes until someone finally helped me. Also let me say too that they were not busy either. The food was shit also. Worst experience I have ever had at a McDonald's.
863,Terrible terrible staff. Waited forever and not a single person acknowledged us at the window. Heard great things about Checkers and was really excited to try it for the first time. We finally decided to leave and the employee came out to confront us and asked if we stuck the middle finger. Kind of ironic that they didn't acknowledge us standing there but so quick to try and start problems. Needless to say I'd be completely content with my life if I never ate at an establishment that hires rude employees.
864,"Ugh...My experience was .  On the DAY OF our event, the unprofessionalism that we faced was totally unacceptable. They were demanding more money and going  to charge $3 per cup of ICE. The one making these executive decisions REFUSED to come out the back (relaying messages through the ""so-called manager""). He was also the one who did the initial meeting for the event and took the full payment. I said to settle all of the he say/she say go get the contract for this event(that was already paid for).  He was denying all that he agreed on but again refused to come from the back, and handle business in a professional manner. This speaks volumes!!!!   I'm Done---getting heated. #BADBOCCIS#BOTCHEDBUSINESSATBOCCIS"
865,Here's a new definition of slow. No one in drive thru a few people in store asked for manager but she was busy talking in dining room. Another girl said who asked for manager then she said if you can't wait then cancel. 20 minutes after it was called on 10 minutes before that. I know it's Camden but damn.
866,Ordered 2 simple meals (from a girl that had a black eye at the 1st window) and they messed up both meals. Very poor trash customer service. Meal were for my kids and the attitude I received when I ordered made me feel as though they'd spit in my kids food. I won't ever go here again.
867,they are unprofessional they hung up on me 3 times and put me on hold more than 4 times because they didn't want to accept the fact they messed up my order i pre paid with my card and they delivered to the WRONG ADDRESS and i clearly told them the right one i was called by two different numbers one telling me they were going to send one out and then later another one saying that they are not going to send anything at all they ignored me because they didn't want to hear what i had to say they are rude and i kept a calm tone the whole Time they said the money would be returned and i would like to speak with the manager but they won't even answer my calls very low place
868,Employees at this McDonald's on Hampton ALWAYS close the store at 9 pm when it says online that they are open until 11 pm. The employees shut the lights off in hopes that no one will come to order food. Poor management and poor employees. No wonder chick Fil A is the champion. This will result in the closing of this McDonald's. Hire people who work.
869,Sad to see this McDonald's going the wrong way in service and product. I would like to add that there is a foul smell here. I thought it was just me so I asked a customer next to me if they were catching the same thing. Somebody has some work to do here if they want to keep this business going. I cant justify going back.
870,"Slow, slow and slower. Burgers are OK if you can get one. Not worth the ridiculous long wait. The place closed once. Shocker. Reopened and still slow and medioce. Service is garbage. Food is mediocre. Same place from the first time they closed. At this rate they will close again."
871,"Ugh...My experience was .  On the DAY OF our event, the unprofessionalism that we faced was totally unacceptable. They were demanding more money and going  to charge $3 per cup of ICE. The one making these executive decisions REFUSED to come out the back (relaying messages through the ""so-called manager"").

He was denying all that he agreed on but again refused to come from the back, and handle business in a professional manner. This speaks volumes!!!!   I'm Done---getting heated."
872,"They are lucky I have to even give one star, I ordered DoorDash from this restaurant and half my order was missing including my 2 year old sons food. I tried calling the store 3 times and nobody answered so we drove to the store and saw they were not busy at all. When we went in they were extremely rude and started threatening to come and beat us up simply because they bagged our order incorrectly and we were asking for the rest of our food. The general manager then told us ""have a nice day and get the fuck out of here."" I don't recommend ANYONE to dine at this place because even our food is cold."
873,Rude night staff including the manager.. Unwilling to make simple substitutions or even explain their lack ability to do so. Instead just stopped talking. I happen to know they can do it because I've done it at other Taco Bell's.
874,"We were ordering drive through. The lady server was friendly and got our orders right, then a boy server showed up at the window got our orders messed up. Worst of all, our burgers, chicken sandwiches, fries, and chicken bites & fries were cold. Still can't believe Checkers serves foods cold."
875,too slow and will have you wait in drive thru for an hour. including other cars. not the right service at all.
876,The  worst McDonald's I've ever been to. I went inside to order and stood there waiting for someone to take my order while 2 people stood behind the counter staring at me and not doing anything. They didn't give me my cup for my drink so I had to stand and wait for that too. The food was old and VERY POORLY made. Fries were extremely old. This place doesn't even deserve one star. Awful
877,"This pizza hut location sucks dick, you're better off just going to the one on Richards Road or in Nolensville. I order a dinner box and once I received it the cheese of every damn slice was just stuck to the box, to make matters worse I requested extra sauce just to barely get any. I would ask them to redo it however I don't want to risk one of them getting mad and spitting in my food.

There's also the issue with the deals there. they're constantly removing the dinner box there, not having pizza under the value line up, and not once has any of the coupons I received in the mail worked on the app for this location.

Just stay away from this pizza specifically"
878,"Why are you looking at a Yelp review for fast food?
Better yet ... why did I just take the time to write and post this?
Eat something else."
879,Three topping with meeting this is not a franchise this is a corner you only can smoke weed over there.
880,The worst McDonalds ever!I walked into lobby got half way to counter a woman informed me the lobby is closed.I asked why ?Talked to the manager she said we are closed and called me a cracker under her breath.REALLY???I wouldn't go thru drive through I was afraid they would spit in my food and I assure you I am always polite!!!
881,"Definitely the worst McDonald's expire NcE I have had in the world.  They often leave things out of orders.   Have even submitted complaints through McDonald's online for this location.   I have noted on several occasions that they take the card at the front window and keep it for longer periods and they walk away with it.   I recently experienced CC fraud and I suspect (cannot prove) that this location may be the culprit, as my card was used directly across the street (and online) to rack up charges.  

If you have to go here use cash and check your order."
882,This was by far a disappointment at the least. We ordered at least $50 worth of food and none of our 4 burrito supremes had any meat. We were shorted tacos . We were parked while the short dread haired lady uses the broom on the sensor to bring her times down in compliance. At any job that is deemed automatic termination in fast food.i wouldn't have cared if my food was made incorrectly. We never asked for no meat or a bean burrito.
883,"Missing item, 2 of the 5 items received were incorrectly prepared - customized to add/remove items, burrito prepared standard, all food was cold, crunchy taco shell was very stale, cinnamon twists tasted burned/cooked in bad oil. Worst Taco Bell experience to date."
884,"Went through the drive thru unfortunately & received the rudest service by a Manger that says her name is JoeAnn. She's very unprofessional speaks very unkind and her attitude is extraordinary nasty. I was told my order was NOT ready please pull up. 
This lady is a very unhinged person. She is not safe to work with the public. She's very threatening and down right rude. Back to what happened.
She wanted to fight over straws. I did not receive any with my order and once I requested them she threw a temper tantrum ran inside the building and refused to bring me any. I got out my car went inside and she wanted to debate if I received them or not. Now why would I walk inside for 2 straws if I actually had them in my bag. Apparently I have no straws. I was indeed upset at the way this person is acting. I kept calm returned to my car & came home. I could not believe my eyes that a adult woman would act like this. I mean stomping around eye rolling neck twisting yelling cursing and very unsafe behavior. 
Called back asked to speak with the manager and guess who the manager is the same temper tantrum throwing immature lady who is unsafe to be around others. I will be calling corporate I live in this community and she should not be around the general public or children. Yelling and cursing and showing aggressive behavior to others is a liability to McDonald's. Noone should have to endure her just to get a Big Mac. 
Honestly the fries were excellent today. She did not put any ice in our drink. It was hot. I won't ever return to this location long as she is employed. She's going to hurt someone."
885,"If someone should say to you, ""Hey, let's go to Granny's for dinner."", make sure they are talking about their Grandmother's house because eating at this Granny's could kill you. We were excited that a new buffet had moved in to the location once occupied by the Luck Buffet and decided to try it. First, none of the food looked all that special but we had to pay to get in. Went through the line and was very pleased with the fried chicken. Until I got it back to the table. It was cold and so were the mashed potatoes. I wish I could tell you about the rest of the food there. It looked like most of it came out of a can or the freezer. I wish I could but we went and ask for our money back. Nothing worse than cold food on a buffet so I have to say, nothing worse than Granny's Buffet."
886,"Just came home from work and stopped to pick up 4 McDoubles  (at about 1:30am) priced at $1.39 each.  I was charged $9.37.  They had no change  (imagine that) available for the $10 total that I gave the young lady.  I asked if the price had gone up, she said yes.  Knowing otherwise I chose not to belabor the point and figured that if she needed the +$3 bad enough to lie and steal for it - She can have it.  Watch out Everyone!.  I'll never patronize that particular restaurant again.  I might as well be held up!"
887,Sorry if you're having construction...but it doesn't mean the workers in there need to ignore the people who still come patron the establishment. But thank you now I know to get a fast food restaurant that's on my way home.
888,"Good evening, my daughter wanted to treat me to dinner for my birthday. we ordered through Door Dash, won't use them again, and not because of the delivery person, he was nice. I wanted oxtails collard greens and rice and beans, and a fish platter with greens, mac and cheese. They didn't have any oxtails, door dash made the mistake and replaced it with jerk chicken. The greens was bland, the rice may have been leftover, the mac and cheese was very dry, the chicken was so spicy we couldn't enjoy it. the best part of this food was the fish, however for the price they charged I expected to get at least 3 nice size pieces of fish, one was a nice size, the other two really small. It's a blessing to have businesses in our neighborhood, especially black owned, but we really need to be mindful about how we prepare and serve whatever it is we're selling. Maybe this was one of their bad days. I'm not trying put their business down, I'm just sharing my experience. The best thing I can suggest is try it for yourself."
889,"This restaurant has the rudest manager I have EVER had to deal with. 
After placing a breakfast order through the app and informing them at the speaker of the order number after waitron in the drive thru I I was told they had canceled my order.
The manager called me a liar about when I had placed the order which is ridiculous because I could not have placed a breakfasts order on the app if it wasn't during breakfast hours. She told me we were ""through"" and slammed the window shut.
I am reported the situation to corporate.
I hope they take the time to review their cameras and see how their employees behave.
This is a disrespectful and disgrace of a store."
890,"Careful y'all...deez hoze don't listen or take orders/follow directions carefully. Prolly did poorly in school, prolly suck as caregivers, and it shows in their service. They'll be wrong and mess up your order then will want to get an attitude when you correct them. Watch out for the ho with blond hair, long nails, and gold teeth. Place is a mess, unprofessional af"
891,Don't waste your time food was cold went when it first opened thought I would give it another try run away from this [lace food tasted like it had been sitting there since lunch time cold.  Don't even want to give it one star.
892,"***They're Stealing from customers!***

Well, taking donations without telling customers. It's only $1 but if they do it to 500 people a day, that's $500 they just stole. 

The young man with the face tattoo is charging people for the TB Foundation without disclosing this information. When I asked him about it he said ""we aren't using the drive thru computer so I had to use the front computer"". Whatever that means, I have no idea. He then said ""You want your dollar back?"" I laughed and said no as it would take more time to get it back than its worth. As I drive off he said ""That's why I put it on there"" with a tone in his voice. So I backed up and said ""excuse me?"" A person with a striped shirt on walked up to the window at the same time and the young man changed what he said to me and said ""oh, i was just saying I know to press no from now on when it asks if you want to donate."" 

Also, I think he was so tied up in stealing my money he forgot to give me the sauce packets he asked me if I wanted. So now I'm back at work to feed my office and we have no sauce. 

I can only assume the employee and the store both get some sort of Kudos for selling/stealing donations for this foundation? I'll be going on social media, Google and Yelp later to let everyone know to check their receipts for money being stolen from then without their knowledge."
893,"Every single person here had a bad attitude and super disrespectful. 

When grabbing my food she asked 'did you have the small coffee?' I said 'no, iced caramel'. Well she didn't listen to me responding to her question and handed me the small coffee. I corrected her and she got mouthy saying she asked. 

Then as I drove slowly through the parking lot, talking to my fiancé on the phone; another employee walking on the side walk smoking said 'get off your damn phone'. I WAS THE ONLY CAR MOVING IN THE PARKING LOT! 

Ohh, I got the wrong food too. 

The customer service at this location is nonexistent. Visited morning of 8/5

As I'm scrolling through all of the shit reviews for this place, my mind is blown even more. This place just needs to be shut down. A representative of McDonald's hasn't even given this platform the time of day"
894,Came to this rally's about 45 minutes before they closed and they refused to make a milkshake. Said they closed all that down since they close soon. Unacceptable service. The lady was rude and didn't even offer to do anything about it. I will NEVER come back to this location. TERRIBLE
895,"Extremely slow !!  Went there the other night to get some sandwiches 15 minutes before they closed.... Doors were locked, The man that open the door said that the grills were all shut down, And everything was put away !!!  Closing time is closing time that's when you turn off the grill not 15 to 30 minutes before!!!!  I will never ever go there to get anything !!!"
896,"I wish I could give this place 0 stars. Management needs to up their game. If you're going to open a 24 hour drive thru, then have enough workers to work or someone to actually watch them. There was no one in front of me and they took 5 mins to even ask for my order. Then when I pulled up to the window to pay, I noticed they walked away to play on their phone, wouldn't even take my payment right away. I love McDonalds bc I can always rely on their fast service but I will never go to this location again."
897,"Pulled in here at 12:30 am after the Super Bowl and NO ONE was inside. 

No one answered the drive thru. 

Drove up to the window and the lights were on but no one at the window or inside."
898,Waited 19 minutes for a small order the other day in drive thru. Every time I visit the experience is subpar at best. The employees (managers included) do not care about guests of the restaurant and it is as if they go out of their way to demonstrate this fact.
899,"NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!! DID NOT DELIVER MY FOOD. WAS NOT GIVEN A REFUND EITHER!!!! 
I ordered $30 worth of food for myself in hopes of supporting the local business, and man was that a shitty idea. Upon ordering my food I was told I'd have to wait 40-50 minutes, it's a Friday night at 1am so I understood and order anyways. 30 minutes after I sent my order I get an email saying it'll be an EXTRA 40-50 minutes, at this point I'm starving. Then, around 2:55 (my estimated delivery time was 2:38) I get a call from the owner (per the driver) screaming at me, saying that I'll need to watch my phone so the driver can tell me when to go get my food and said that I needed to go get my food because they were very busy and could not bring it to the door, I guess. Then I get another call from the screaming owner saying that the driver was looking for my apartment and calling me, mind you I was working so my phone was right in front of me and nobody had called. At 3 in the morning TWO HOURS FROM WHEN I ORIGINALLY ORDERED MY FOOD, I got another screaming call from the man supposed to be the owner saying that the drives has been calling me and to pick up my phone, I had yet to receive a call from anyone but the screaming man. He tells me there's an issue with finding my place and he was two buildings down from where I live so I told him and he screamed back that he does not have time for this and that he is not delivering my order, through all the yelling I managed to catch him say there is no refund. Had He gone somewhere that was not near my place I would understand but I COULD HAVE WALKED TO WHERE HE WAS. The driver calls me and tells me there's no time to deliver my food and hangs up. I will NEVER EAT HERE. THESE PEOPLE WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY AND NOT PROVIDE THE SERVICE PROMISED ALL BECAUSE THEY ARE UNDERSTAFFED. I would give them zero stars if possible. My roommate reported this THEFT to the Largo Police department!"
900,"At 8:30 AM after waiting 10 minutes in the drive-through line; I was told that because the manager is in the bathroom, they cannot serve us.
They are rarely open for breakfast."
901,"They gave me a regular coke instead of a Diet Coke. And they forgot the chocolate milk for the happy meal...let's just say, I wasn't happy."
902,This is absolutely one of the worst McDonald's there is an Metairie . I used to come here five days a week and out of those five days four days would be something wrong or incorrect with my food. On my way to work I decided to OK well let me try it again I have been in line and drive-through for 21 minutes finally asking the drive-through cashier what's going on she claims there's only four employees working. They just spent thousands and thousands of dollars remodeling this McDonald's why when the doors need to be shut . And if anyone from McDonald's thinks I'm exaggerating do me a favor take a ride through the drive-through I can promise you something will be wrong . I am not kidding at all they just handed me my food and it was the wrong order. I swear I cannot even get over this store it's just too unbelievable to even believe
903,The most stupid McDonald worker ever. Never got the order right always missing food. Will never come back to this stupid place again.
904,"The worst experience I have ever received at any food established, poorly run manager was doing all the work while the employees dragged their feet in laziness"
905,On sunday i ordered food i got cups for drinks and went back up to counter and continued to wait for my meals..guy at register comes over and asked did you get your food yet i said no.....he looks at order and grabs food and puta it in a bag...iasked him for fresh food since it was sitting there getting cold he continued to slide bags over to me and i said i wanted fresh food or go get a manager....she was walking around on the phone the whole time. She finally came out the back with a new guy and a new register as i am still waiting...she finally comes over and askes what do you want....i said i wanted new food cause it was sitting there or i want my money back...her comment back was well which do you want...i got my money back and left everything on the counter...it was veey poor customer service
906,"I have had better fozen pizza. 

Rude service, overpriced , cold pizza without flavour.  Will never eat here again.

You'd be better off with microwaved no name pizza pockets."
907,"Thank you for allowing my pizza to sit out instead of in a warmer, so by the time I got there it was already ice cold. Thankfully, the pizza was on sale."
908,This place doesn't even deserve a star takes over 5 mins for someone even to acknowledge you in drive-thru then when you order the ice cream machine is ALWAYS broken doesn't matter what time of day it is good is always cold and their nuggets taste like they are days old.
909,"Typically if I review Fast food there is a strong possibility that it's going to get a 3 star review unless the mess something up, however this Jack in the Box is far from a 3 star rating and probably ranks at the bottom of the list when it comes to customer service. First this location is always painfully slow, drive thru or inside. Service is horrible, good luck getting your order and be sure to check it before leaving. I will say that the staff is friendly, however they clearly are understaffed and could use more training along with some leadership. The food here is just what you would expect from Jack in the Box, it's the service that needs some serious improvements. Aside from that this location shares a building with an attached Phillips 66 Gas Station, and to get here you have to navigate through the gas station which can sometimes be frustrating. The drive thru is a cluster during peak hours resulting in long lines and people often getting in the way of those at the station.

Simply put, avoid this location like the plague, unless it's a last resort which unfortunately it is for me at times."
910,"I am happy to see this location close. I have not visited this location in some time, due to the fact that the staff was unprofessional and the food was always cold. Who ever the young skinny African American girl was working the drive-thru each time, had ZERO customer service skills, and made the visit horrible each time. Along with the management. That place was a preschool with no teachers or authority. The restaurant was always dirty. Every single time I went in there, the floors were dirty, the tables were dirty, the bathrooms smelled better after someone would use them compared to how they would normally smell. Glad to see this location close. Maybe a new restaurant or business will come in that actually values their customers."
911,"This McDonald's is horrendous, they always forget things. They are beyond rude and inappropriate to customers. I don't usually come here to give bad reviews but this place needed one. This is one of the worst McDonalds I've ever been to. If I could give this place a quarter star I would. Every single time I've come here they claim their ice cream machine is broken, every. Single. Time. I think they're all just too lazy to clean it out or give it proper mantinence."
912,"Aweful!
Flyer in my hotel room and ordered seafood pizza and a meatball and cheese calzone.
Ordered no sauce in the calzone.. order came and sauce was in the calzone and the pizza was like cardboard. The ""seafood"" on the pizza was supposed to be shrimp and crab. The shrimp were the itsy bitsy shrimps the size of a dime and the crab was the imitation crap... NOT crab as advertised. I counted 29 on the extra large pizza - again, they are the size of a DIME. The ""crab"" was just over a heaping tablespoon... again, this is an extra large pizza.
I call them immediately so the driver could turn around come back and get the food and reimburse me. The girl told me she would have to get her manager and that she knows she wrote down on the calzone no sauce. A guy named Mario picked up the phone and said he's sorry he made the food he'll bring me another calzone. I said no thank you you ruined my dinner plus the pizza is absolutely awful; it's dry and there's no seafood on it and I'm not paying $20 for a piece of cardboard. He said ""Too bad, I'm in charge of the food and I'll give you a partial refund but you're not getting fully refunded just because you don't like the food"". I told him to come back and get his food I don't want it this is not meeting my expectations in any way and he hung up on me.
I called back Mario answered and I said I want a refund he said I'm not getting one and hung up again.
Will be writing the BBB, consumer affairs and whoever else I need to."
913,"I ordered a small coffee and a cup of fruit oatmeal. After waiting in line for about 10 minutes, I was given the wrong order. I explained what I orders and they have me the coffee and told me to pull forward to wait for the oatmeal.  It then took just under 10 minutes to bring me the oatmeal.  OATMEAL!!!!"
914,"This place is unbelievable. Ordered appetizers, wings and pizza. They had no wings, the pizza came out before the appetizers and when the appetizers came out they were over cooked. The waitress was nice but I will not come to this pizza hit again. For the money you spend the food should be cooked right."
915,Totally gross! How this place even stays open and out of the health departments eyes is beyond me! The food is disgusting! The place is totally filthy! Employees are outside smoking in the front of the building then running in and handling food. The grease from our fries leaked all over all our other food. Even the outside tables were totally filthy. Definite complaint being filed with corporate and health department.
916,Worst McDonalds ever!! Not sure why this place is still open!! I pulled up to to place my order and didn't receive any answer after waiting about 5 minutes. I decided to pull up and the lady with a hand motion telling me they are closed during normal operating hours. No signs or anything to suggest they were closed. I will never buy from this McDonalds!!
917,The drive-thru workers are rude and incompetent. There was a hair in my sandwich. Enough said.
918,"Nasty. Nasty, nasty..........  My food was okay. But the inside of the restaurant was so bad I don't know how the health department hasn't shut it down. Oh wait, it's St Louis. The whole area is a dump. So that's why. 

The soft drink machine was malfunctioning and syrup was in a moat around it. And water was just standing in the place you're supposed to sit your cup. Gross. I only ate here because I was staying at the Holiday Inn next door. And I survived the meal without getting the screaming shits. So maybe it deserves 2 stars? Nah..........."
919,"I would give them no stars, but you can't to write a review without giving at least one. Rather than complaining I will just rattle off the problems and let you decide... First, we waited 40 minutes for three subs and a salad. VERY SLOW. No Italian bread, no sauce for the meatballs (so I couldn't get what I wanted there), no carved chicken for the salad, and no onions. They rang everything up and we paid before we found out about the no carved chicken. Out of the three of them no one knew how to issue a refund. They had to call someone. Wound up going to another subway, even after the 40 minute wait, for the salad. Oh yea... While we were waiting for the refund one of the employees decided to make himself a sandwich out of the meatballs they put out for my sandwich (without the sauce) and grilled that baby up for a snack for later. Nice!

I have to give cudos to the gentlemen that was there on his day off trying to help the other two do their jobs. He was at least apologetic where the other two kept indicating that it wasn't their fault.

Oh yea... Almost forgot... I wound up ordering a Oven Roasted Chicken and the dude grabs it from the bin and plops in on the bread. He commences to ask about my cheese and I ask him if he was going to heat those up. He then says ""oh yea""... Glad I didn't get anything with bacon on it...

NEVER GOING BACK TO THIS LOCATION

My wife and I keep returning to give them another chance but with another opening right around the corner in tri-city... NEVER AGAIN!"
920,"Went there tonight at about 825pm. There was one guy waiting on his order. As I walked in all three associates rolled their eyes. Without exaggeration, I stood there for 3-4 without anyone acknowledging my existence. 
I left without saying a word. When I got to the parking lot, that guy that was inside stopped me in the parking lot asking me ""this place is a piece of shit huh?"" He said he was on the verge of walking out himself when they stopped him. He said after that, he order 1 burrito that took five minutes to make and they gave it to him with no regard as well. 
This is a problem in the world. I don't demand to be waited on hand and foot, but for Christs sake, at least say something to a paying customer. 

The last time I went there they greeted me in a fast manner, then took 10 minutes to get my food. I asked if they had forgotten about me and the cashier said ""no sir, just be patient.""---- I was the only person there and the drivethru

Oh, but they sure do have posterboards saying happy birthday ms d, and employee of the month and random collages. Let's get the Taco Bell business done first, then the left over bullcrap comes second"
921,horrible!!!!! how do you think you deserve more $$ an hour!? you people have no brains! cant even make a meal right!
922,"Hadn't been to a Rally's in probably 10 years. Out driving with someone else that suggest we stop here to eat. Had no issues with politeness or anything like that. The food on the other hand was awful. The hamburgers were tiny! Smaller than Wendy's JR size. Ok so that's an issue with Rally's Corp now for this location, we pulled over to eat in the parking lot but when I opened the bag the food smelled like human poop! Not kidding it was so bad smelling like someone went to the bathroom in the food. We just threw it out the window. A waste of my money and not sure why is smaller that way. I wouldn't trust the food there."
923,"Haven't been here in about a year, but the guy running it previously was terrible. He stingy down to the last pickle. I've seen him pick small portions of food out of my sub when he put too much in and then put it back. And I've heard he's a total jerk from people that worked there."
924,This place is a dump.  Last visit ever.  Took 26 minutes to get my order and 5 more to get sauce!  Disgusting garbage all over the floor behind the counter.  No one in the restaurant because they were smarter than me and ditched the line.
925,"Only waited in line at the drive through for 15 minutes. Kat that time the man in the car ahead of us got out to pee in the bushes. The sign said it was open but conversations sparked in the drive through line. ""Is someone alive in there?"" ""Should we call 911?!"" 
End of the night and we pulled out the Taco Bell line. We gave up on this establishment, no chalupa or delicious empanada in hand. Each car deciding as a group to back out of the line and resign our desires to the night, like feathers in the wind. This Taco Bell let me down."
926,"Worst experience ever, I recommend everyone to go anywhere but here. The owner is nastier than the mgr and does not correct the issue. If I could give negative stars I would happily. This food is not even worthy for pigs. I don't understand how anyone can run a business this way and then you get the owner involved and he was completely worse than the mgr and completely belligerent. I will be sending letters also to all the correct directions to make sure this does not happen to others. Frozen pizza from the grocery is by far better and you know what your getting. Drunk college kids would not even eat this stuff. I hope this place gets bought out and becomes a much better operation and just closes down so that they don't take advantage of others with there nasty food and not fix the issue once you complain about. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.."
927,Terrible terrible service. Very slow and untrained staff. No comprehension of processes or taking and completing orders. 3 staff just walking around in the dinning room drink lunch time. Will never come to this location again.
928,Me and son was excited to get Mc Donald's today when got to get ready to our order at the 2nd window the lady was very rude and had a nasty attitude she shoved my food to me my son was like wow mom she has a nasty attitude then when I ask for catchup and salt she act as if she was mad and try to rush me more. When driving off I notice they didn't even give me any sauce for my nuggets I so upset this was the worse customer service every y'all need help ASAP New Manager and better customer service
929,"Granted it is only Wendy's but this one is by far the worst I've ever been to. I ordered a number one with a Coke and yes I understand this is a very complicated order but they made me sit there for five minutes because the fries work done there was absolutely nobody in the entire store and they completely forgot I was sitting there

Oh I forgot to add that this was drive-through with nobody in front of me and nobody behind me I would stay far away God only knows what they're doing or how they're making the food"
930,"We were in there on Sunday morning, before 11 am.  The entire dining room was filthy - food on the floor, tables were dirty, condiments weren't full.  Restrooms were filthy as well.  Waited for five minutes before the girl behind the counter turned around to wait on us.  The only good thing about the whole trip was that the food was hot and fresh - otherwise - stay away!"
931,"Worst Donair I ever had
Tastes horrible
I think I'm going to throw up because of da Donair
It permanently damaged my previous amazing thoughts on Donair
Presentation is also pretty indecent."
932,Ok this location i would go to alot but lately its has gone down hill everytime i order the food is cold or the order is wrong then what tops it all off is that for a week (5 days) the only thing they had to drink.was water i will never go back there again they need to.close the doors
933,I just don't have anything nice to say about my experience with this McDonalds its really not my job to help the business provide better service.  I see enough complaints already and nothings changed so clearly the owner isn't concerned.  After all why should the owner care if people he or she is still getting business right?  Oh and how bout you fix the milk shake machine that has been down for 12 years now or train the employees to use it...
934,Don't know why but every time I come here my order is always wrong.  Ordered a Chicken Delux and got a small chicken with lettuce sandwich.  Never fails my order is always wrong.
935,"The ""lady"" that took my order was upset because I didn't want toppings on my oatmeal.  (I've gotten it without toppings at other locations, and she was very upset that I didn't know I had to request it at this particular location.)  She slammed the one I returned into the trash and loudly complained to her coworker about me.  I feel sorry for anyone pathetic enough that their day is utterly ruined by a customer's oatmeal preference."
936,"This Taco Bell continues to go down hill. The place is a mess and after 5 minutes still no help with nobody in line. The attitude of the staff needs much improvement since customer service is nonexistent. I wish the corporate office would step in and take control of the employees and clean this place up. 

Its been 10 minutes and the cashier has looked at me several times and walked away without saying a word! 

It took a total of 28 minutes from the time I walked in to receive my order."
937,"The WORST!!!!!! McDonald's I've everrrrrrr visited!!!! The worst! 

Waited 20minutes, 20 minutes!!! Till someone spoke to me, just to ask ""oh, what did you order?""  just to get cold fries, and over an cooked chicken sandwich and the wrong drink. 

This location deserves NO stars, but it wouldn't let me post my review"
938,"Not even worth a full review. Avoid, avoid, avoid. Get your pizza from literally ANYWHERE else. I have never seen a back kitchen so ""In the weeds"" before in my life. And all just for takeout/delivery orders. Very sad."
939,"I had the worst possible experience coming to this location. Rude workers, and the manager was rude, ignorant and mean towards customers. Sign claims they cater to ALL DAY breakfast, yet at 10 AM they had no mcgriddles left. After sitting at the drive through for 20 minutes I asked for a refund FIVE times with the manager ignoring me and after the fifth time asking the manager finally responded rudely telling me I should have said I wanted a refund earlier, which I did. I finally left and went to Burger King because they definitely have better service then whatever this trashy place did."
940,"Customer service is terrible. Every single time I've come here I've been attended by the same lady with the nasty attitude. The one who has pink hair and apparently wears blue eyeshadow every day of the week. Last time the smoothie machine was ""broken"" today the coffee machine is ""broken"" my guess is she doesn't want to be bothered to make the extra effort than to take someone's order."
941,"Terrible service. Waited 15 minutes for my food. Then, the quarter pounder was cold and the cheese was hard and brownish.  The fries were cold and tasted like the fryer grease hadn't been changed in awhile.  Very bad after taste of old grease.  2 thumbs down on this sad Mickey d's    : ("
942,ALWAYS have to pull to the side and wait for my order. A lot of times they only accept cash and the lights are turned off like they are closed. Also the freakin ice cream machines are also broke and soggy ass fries.
943,"Ordered the 2 for 5.99 and they got the pizza completely wrong. I ordered sausage, beef and bacon and I got pepperoni only."
944,Service was terrible.  Unbelievably slow!  Don't ever eat here.  Have been waiting 20 minutes so far for 2 tacos!!!  And they call it fast food??????? 8 people standing in line 10 minutes to place an order??? Really????  After waiting 25 minutes I asked for my money back. Had to wait for that too.  No apologies.  Rude staff.
945,"I have not visited a Subway since moving to NJ (Land of Wawa) 4.5 years ago. Now, I remember why.
I stopped in on a Friday afternoon at 12:25. There was exactly one employee working. Regardless, I waited in the line. The single employee was quick and friendly and that is the only positive thing I have to say.
I ordered a footlong tuna salad sub. I am not even remotely exaggerating when I say there was 10 times the bread as there was tuna salad, onions and pickles. Ridiculous! The bread was not even all that fresh. The tuna salad was not as good as I remembered it being and there wasn't enough there to even call it a tuna salad sub.
Back to Wawa I go for future sub experiences."
946,"Even though this Wendy's location was recently redone, and it looks very nice now, it's service has not changed. I might say it's even worse. They need to find new employees or a better manager. Something needs to be done to fix the horrible service at this Wendy's. The one across town is always a better bet."
947,"Came here at 9 am. Line moves fast. Ordered some food for my work center so it was a large order. They gave me my total of $33 at the ordering machine. I get to the front window and the read off an order which isn't mine. So they said ""oh okay you had the big breakfast"" so I was like ""yeah I ordered a lot. It's a BIG breakfast"" me not knowing that was an actual item on the menu. But the woman didn't read me off the cost when I handed her my card. She swiped it and gave me the receipt. At that point I went to the next window and saw it was a $7 purchase. Needless to say I said something, the second window was nice about it and understood the confusion. She talked with a few other people and then the woman at the first window came back and was rudely yelling at me ""you said that was your order"". I refused to give back my card for them to reswipe it bc they messed up. The manager apologized and let me go with the food but I had to come back inside anyways because they forgot my drink and the jelly. Don't come to this McDonald's. Rude service"
948,"We got here and it took the person at the window 5mins to take our order and then once we ordered we sat at the window for 10mins before the woman at the window told us to pull around to the side, park and wait for our food. Now if they were extremely busy and we had a complicated order, I could over look it but it was pretty dead for a Wednesday night around 9:00. We ended up waiting for over 25mins for like 6 sandwiches and a large fry and it went on way past 10 before we even got our food. TERRIBLE SERVICE and if I could give it a negative star I would."
949,As of 7-29-18 this location still won't make a milkshake. The machine is either still actually broken or they're pretending it won't work.
950,"For people claiming to want $15 an hour I would think they could remember to put hot sauce with my burrito. The most idiotic children work here; slow, rude, and I'm lucky if it's fresh."
951,Horrible! The worst dining experience I have ever had. I don't know where to begin. The place was severely understaffed. My wide and I arrived and were told to pick a seat. About 10 minutes later a waitress came to our table and asked us for our order. We were given no menus and to save time we just ordered the buffet. We were assured that it was just about to be restocked. We waited around a bit and then had to track someone down for plates. I was told they only had small plates so we took these. After getting some food (almost none left but I was assured it was to be restocked) We found ourselves without silverware. Again I had to track someone down and was told they were out of silverware and was offered a plastic fork. I took this and went back to my seat. After another 15 minutes went by we finally received our drinks. Another 10-15 minutes and still no restocking of the buffet.  At this point my lunch time was over. I then had to track someone down to pay. I never left a buffet hungry before. Never again...
952,14 dollars for a slice of pizza and medium fountain pop. I asked the clerk to verify the price and he just nods his head and brushes me aside and says next. I move aside still trying to find the price for their pizza and pop. Low and behold neither is in his menu board. So I can't really complain if there is no price to go by. I just put my head down and took the disgusting 10 dollar slice of pizza and 4 dollar flat root beer to my son and said sorry you have to eat that. I proceeded to the Pho place next door and was just as disappointed.
953,The worst service I have ever had!  DO NOT GO TO THIS MCDONALDS!!!! The lady that was cleaning the floors with a spray bottle and mop stopped cleaning to put together a food order and did not wash her hands or use gloves!  She also touched the inside of a cup that was used for the ice cream we ordered. This is insanitary and I will not go back here!
954,"Just left the drive through and asked them if I could add on a French fry and they told me it was ""company policy"" that they couldn't add things on at the window, then I got my order and I had asked for my fries well done (crispy obviously, I ask this everywhere I go) and they weren't, so when I told them they were soggy, they told me that they don't know what I mean and they use a timer? LOL. It's not rocket science, I have my fries cooked this was everywhere I go! I just couldn't believe how they acted so dumbfounded by everything!"
955,"Stopped in for lunch at 11:30 on a Monday, to see how it compared to our lackluster experiences at the Fairless Hills location. ""How could it possibly be worse?"" we joked. Well, I'm pretty sure we jinxed ourselves.

Walked in to an empty restaurant. Ok, it's early... let's give it a try. We were greeted by a less-than-enthusiastic server, who told us to take a seat. Ok, maybe she's just tired; it -is- early for lunch. She came by to take our drink orders and gave us our silverware... a single fork. 5 minutes later she came back with our drinks and took our order: breadsticks to start, and then two regular personal pizzas. Simple, right? Roughly 15-20 minutes later, she brings out our breadsticks, but no plates. My grandmother asked for plates, and the server disappeared into the back. When she finally brought out plates, we pointed out that the sauce for the breadsticks was ice cold, and asked if she could heat it up, and she said that we would have to speak to a manager. Manager eventually comes out (at the same time as our pizzas... as we haven't yet been able to eat our appetizer...), and insists that all Pizza Huts serve their breadsticks at room temperature. We pointed out that the sauce was legitimately cold to the touch, and she snapped that it was room temperature- it was just cold in the building. The manager, after arguing for a minute, eventually did us the ""favor"" of heating up our sauce... and took her time doing so. We'd finished half of our pizzas before we were able to start eating our appetizer.

All in all, the food was Ok. The breadsticks were very overcooked and smaller than any location I've been to, but the pizzas were good. The sorry excuse for a manager definitely put a bad taste in our mouths. We had originally planned to go to Wendy's, and obviously should have. So if you're looking for mediocre food and horrible service (even by Pizza Hut standards!), by all means, give them a try."
956,"Today (Wednesday, November 27, 2013), I went to the McDonald's located at 709 Terry Parkway in  Gretna, LA 70056 with my boss.  

I order the food at 11:57AM (that is the exact time the receipt said). We drove thru the drive thru.  We order a number 16 (10 chicken nuggets, fries, coke and barbeque sauce) and a number 17 (Filet-o-fish, fries and tea).  We pulled up to the first window and paid.  At the second window, they asked us to pull up to wait for our food.  That is when the trouble started.

After waiting for 12 minutes, one of the employees came out (at 12:09) and asked us if we had the Fish Filet and the McRibs.  When we told her we had the Fish and the nuggets, she said ""yeah, this is your order"". We open the bag and notice it was not our order and corrected her. She went back inside the restaurant.  In another words, she brought us the wrong order and then tried to lie about it. 

Two minutes later at 12:11, she came back outside and asked for our receipt and went back inside (we never got our receipt back).

So a minute later at 12:12, she came back outside with the wrong order again.  She brought the same thing she brought out the first time (Fish Filet and the McRibs).  If it was not the right order the first time, why would she think it was the right order three minutes later?

My boss went inside at 12:13 to try to get the right order.  She ended up coming out with the Filet-O-Fish and a six piece nuggets (after paying for a ten piece nuggets).  At that point, we quit trying to get the right order. So after three tries and 15 minutes, they still could not get the order right.

This is that worst service I ever received at any restaurant I ever been too.  The employees gave us the wrong food three different times, tried to lie to us one time, and had to wait 15 minutes to almost get the right order.  I do expect better service than this and this is a problem that McDonald's should fix.  There is no excuse for such bad service."
957,I'd rather drive out of Belle Chasse than order from here. They can't seem to do any order right and the attitudes are horrible. I just don't eat mayo it isn't that hard. It's supposed to be fast food but nothing is fast about this place.
958,"Looking at all the one star reviews, it's not surprising to see that the location has closed. I was in the shopping center June 1, 2018 and it's now a financial institution."
959,"The customer service is horrendous.  After every item that I ordered, the cashier would give me the final price instead of asking if there was anything else I wanted.  After about the 3rd time, you would think he would get the picture that I'm not quite done ordering.  Customer service at its worse."
960,"If nothing else, they are consistent! Today was one of the rare occasions when I actually got my order without being pulled forward and the food was correct. Of course, even during their prime dinner rush time my fries and my son's nuggets were still cold. I thought that since they were busy the fries wouldn't have had time to sit long enough to be that cold but somehow they found a way. I feel bad writing this but it really is the worst McDonald's in the St. Charles area. This was one of the best visits I've had there and it was still disappointing. Their one redeeming quality is that they have a redbox. My suggestion is, go in and rent a movie before using the drive through so you have something to watch while you wait for your fries to get cold enough for them to serve."
961,"Hard to order through the bullet proof glass. Super unclean. And employees are rude. If you crave Taco Bell, go anywhere else please."
962,Can't believe Mackers is still in business with the crap assortment.....   should have gone the way of the dino's years ago...
963,"I went through the drive thru and had to wait 20 minutes to get my food just for the lady who brought it out to get an attitude with me bc when she repeated my order I said yes but when she asked the car next to mine about their order they said that wasn't it so she turned back to my car and said ""that's why I asked you if this was your order"" with an attitude and practically threw the bag at my boyfriend. We then get home and the order was completely wrong. I ordered three things and only got two and the two I got weren't what I ordered. So my boyfriend and I go back and when we go inside and tell them we got the wrong order there was no apology or anything just ""okay well what did you have?"" We brought the order back with the receipt so it was right there for them to see but they obviously just don't care so we go back home with the correct order and what do you know they got it wrong again. This McDonald's just doesn't care in the least bit about quality service and accuracy. I'd recommend going to the one on vets And transcontinental because whenever I've gone there the service is quick, the workers are always friendly, and my order is always correct."
964,"This is one of the worst McDonald's I have ever been in. They are always slow at the drive-thru and inside. The drink  and condiment station is often a mess and in disarray. The outdoor play are isn't too great either. It is small and not in the best condition. It's disappointing that with our limited fast food options in Belle Chasse, we have such a lousy place that I avoid at all costs."
965,holy cow .....how much brains will it take to screw together a sub .....this one is the pits.
966,"Today my husband and I went to this McDonald's to get our lunch. When we got back to work I opened up my burger, there was a bite out of the burger. I took the burger back and all that was offered to me was a drink. I said no because I had a drink and the manager threw in an apple pie into my bag. I hate apple pies. I called the corporate office and they were much nicer to me then anyone there at that McDonalds. I hope to get my money refunded to me. I will never eat there again."
967,"My first one star review ever!

We are in Gretna visiting the in-laws. Every time I come to the New Orleans area, I am reminded of why I moved to Texas in the first place. Today's reminder came from this McDonald's. I have come to expect a certain standard of service at fast food places in this area, namely the employees are generally insulted by the fact that you are placing an order, and don't take kindly to ""Whitey.""

This place went well above and beyond to make sure today's visit was miserable. My 5 yo daughter insisted on eating at ""Old McDonald's"" and I was unable to dissuade her. We started the visit by using the restroom. Big mistake. Totally filthy.

Then we placed our order. Or at least we tried to. We were eventually noticed by an employee who was delighted to tell us that they were out of chicken nuggets and would not be getting any for about an hour. Thankfully my daughter did not flip out. we changed our order and took our ticket, as the employee glared at us with obvious hatred in her eyes. If you are thinking, ""Well, he must have said something or done something to set her off,"" then you obviously are not a New Orleans native and are not used to being treated like a subhuman.

I stood there for twenty minutes as all of the other customers were served, including those who came in ten minutes after we did. Many of them had ordered similar things. 

I followed the first rule of New Orleans fast food dining: ""DO NOT COMPLAIN""

Violating this rule has been known to result in food with ""Special Sauce"" added, as well as physical violence and even armed confrontation. 

Instead I just stood there with my daughter in my arms until another employee (who actually was not overtly hostile) noticed us and took pity. She took my ticket and personally saw that it was filled. I have noticed that even in the worst situation, there is always at least one person who reminds me that not all people are scum. 

Ironically, by the time we got our food, the expected chicken nuggets had arrived, but they were now out of all of the soft drinks except for ""orange drink"" and iced tea. I took a water even though I paid for a fountain drink and kept my mouth shut (see rule 1 above). 

Oh yeah, and the fries were stale and the burgers were slimy.

I expected a sub-par experience by normal standards, but this place sucked by NEW ORLEANS standards! That is tough to achieve."
968,"HORRIBLE customer service, and I wish I had read the reviews before I ordered. Found out from the lady at the front desk of the hotel I was staying in, after my experience with them that they're BAD NEWS and suck. So yea. I ordered at 10pm. I was told 30 minute for pick-up so I said ok. Which was rediculous but whatever I didn't care. I waited the 30 minutes and went over to the place. When I got there the guy behind the counter asked what my order was, then said ok 5 more minutes, I said fine it's been over 30 minutes but I can wait. He then goes to the back comes out and says wait I don't have that order at all. What was it again. So I tell him AGAIN what my order is... He then with a VERY NASTY attitude proceeds to tell me that I called back and cancelled. Which I never did. Then gives me an attitude telling me there nothing he can do it was never even made. You cancelled the order. Again I said no I didn't and I even showed him my phone, which shows I only called the place once. He continued to be nasty to me but I brushed it off and asked if I order now how long will it take since YOU made the mistake and cancelled something I never called back to cancel. He looked at me and in another nasty tone said you'll have to wait another 30 minutes. I looked and him and said are you serious, to which he said damn right. This man is not nice and shouldn't be working here at all. I asked for a manager because by this time I was irate and very annoyed. And he then tells me he was the manager. So I look at him and say great customer service I'll make damn sure my hotel knows what happened and make sure you can't flyer there ever again. This isn't how you gain business this is how you lose it. He didn't care and went on to help the next person who was there, who's order was missing as well. This guy was a nasty jerk. I will never order here again. And what makes it worse I was just in town on vacation, so to give that expierence to someone. Just horrid. Wish I could give this place a 0 star rating cause they DON'T deserve the 1 star. Tell your friends to stay away from this place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
969,This is a great Mcdonalds if you want your order screwed up. I have been several times and everytime i order a burger and up with a salad. I think if you have to go use small words and sound them out so they understand
970,"Wish there was a negative star option- AVOID - not sure what is going on here but they must stay in business solely from Bucs games- we were traveling through Tampa and thought a chain would be the safe choice...we were very wrong. We should have left when we noticed we were the only people in there at noon on a Sun. It was cash only (another red flag) and it took 20 mins to get 5 meals even with 5 people behind the counter- they seemed bothered by our presence-a guy and his son came in after us and were served before ours came out, two different people who ordered at the drive through came in to try and find their food- we should have just walked away from our $40 because even the food was horrible. Unfortunately most people don't use Yelp when going to a fast food chain but Wendy's corporate should pull their franchise."
971,"I'm not sure how this place has avoided new ownership or management coming in and taking over. I always assumed that the McDonald's empire had some sort of review process or QC department to keep their restaurants running efficiently and effectively.  This has been our local McD's for about 4 years but we've learned to drive 3 miles out of our way for our Big Mac cravings.  Unless I was alone getting just a single burger, I avoided this place.  The ability to correctly fulfill and order for 2 adults and 2 children completely eludes this establishment.  My wife and I were trying to remember a time when we went here and they got everything right, we couldn't think of any, seriously.  
Last time I was there (about a month ago) I ordered $6 worth of food and they asked me to pull up because they had a problem with they're fryers and it would be a couple of minutes on the fries. No problem.  I turned the game on and waited... 25 min.  I know I should have went in after just 10 min, but I'm a pretty patient person and they started bringing food out to all of the other cars that were waiting (about 7 of them) so I figured it wouldn't be too much longer.  When I finally started to get out of the car the empty handed manager was knocking on my window.  He explained that they lost my order and needed it again.
I'll refrain from detailing my ""conversation"" with this man, but suffice to say it was my last visit until I see ""New Management"" on their reader board.
Reviewing a fast food joint always seemed silly to me, low priced food = low wages = lack of interest in getting your order right.  It's a risk we all take every time we buy food from the front seat of our cars.  I just wish someone would have warned me how consistently bad this place was.  Screaming kids in a long drive-thru is bad enough, but seeing their disappointment when their nuggets aren't in the bag time and time again is too much.  Lesson learned, albeit a little late.

The McD's at Elm and 370 is much faster and the one on 5th street seems OK but it's kind of a pain to get in and out of."
972,"RUDE WORKERS and MANAGER.  Called to order delivery bc I was staying in a hotel and this flyer came under the door. When I called I explained the hotel I was staying in but the person on the phone said he didn't understand what hotel that was and needed an address.  Firstly, know where you advertise. Then he proceeded to tell me the store had magically closed because his boss said so. Looks like I didn't miss much anyway since they seem to be serving dog food."
973,They don't really care about the customers. They always mess up the order...they forget to put everything I order in drive thru. they need good employees..but they just hire anyone.
974,"The restaurant was almost totally deserted when I walked in--only two other tables with people, already eating. I waited at the counter for a few minutes before someone finally came; she told me I could take a seat. I waited another five minutes before someone came to my table. I told her I wanted a personal pan pizza with pepperoni and some water. She told me it would be ten minutes.

A half hour later, *another* server asks me if I've been helped. I told him I'd been waiting for a half hour; he calls the original server, who informs me ""the cook messed up"" and I would have to wait even longer. At this point, I just walked out--I was too hungry to wait any longer. I'm not sure how they screwed up an order that they usually pre-prepare and put out under heat lamps at other Pizza Huts, but they did. Geez."
975,"Open 24/7, really??! No one responds to take orders at the drive through at 11:00 pm! I waited a few minutes and left.. so the driver on the other line. Terrible service! Shame!"
976,"""We're not serving breakfast right now"" it's 845 in the morning Taco Bell. This location used to be one of the few good ones in the city but even they going downhill"
977,"I don't know what it is about this McDonald's but it seems like every time we go there our order is messed up.  They either forget something, or wrong items are sent out. Also sometimes the buns are stale. The drinks sometimes do not taste right or they are out of them. Where is the manager?"
978,"OK, I know it's KFC, but in the spirit of Yelping everything, here goes...

This was a horrible fast food experience.

It's a crappy neighborhood, so I didn't expect a ""pleasant"" experience, but jeez... it's a national chain... aren't they held to standards?

My mom and I stopped after a doctor's appointment, and what the hell was I thinking.

We were told upon ordering that the crispy chicken was cooking and would be about a 10-minute wait. After about 30 minutes, they called our order. I get to the window, and he informs me that they don't have enough crispy chicken to fulfill my order. Um, dude, didn't you just say y'all were cooking some when we ordered??? Oh, right... it's all gone now cuz the next 10 orders that came in after we arrived had already been filled while we sat patiently and waited.

So, I say fine, I will eat original chicken... well, my side orders were wrong, even though they were printed correctly on the receipt... how do you get mashed potatoes and gravy out of COLE SLAW. It doesn't sound the same or even look the same, right?

Then I get home, cuz I'm not hanging around that joint, lol... they got bulletproof glass for a reason, and it's getting dark. I see no reason to learn why they need the bulletproof gas in a fkn KFC. So, anyway, one chicken wing tasted like it was left over from the day before, and the others were kind of hard, like they had been sitting under the heat lamp all day.

Yes, I called the 800 number on the back of the receipt, but I wasn't allowed to complete the survey. The automated system informed me that calls from store locations, employees and their families weren't allowed and I would have to call back from another phone.

Um... I have never worked for KFC, nor has anyone in my family, and I called from my CELL PHONE. UGH."
979,"Worst service imaginable. Always screw up order, always an attitude,  from EVERY employee, especially managers. Close when they feel like it. Don't waste your time here"
980,"This place was very quick for a long time. For the last 6 months or so, there are constant problems. Long lines of people and the staff just can't get it together. There is a high turnover rate on employees so there are always new people and they don't know what they are doing. I'll be driving to other locations to avoid this one."
981,"Literally the slowest JITB you will find anywhere. If you come anytime remotely close to lunch, be prepared to be in the drive thru for at least 20-30 minutes. Not exaggerating. It is unreal how slow this place handles their drive thru. Heck, I'm writing this from the line right now! I've been here long enough to zone out for a good 10 minutes listening to music and look, I STILL have time to log in here and write this review! AND there are still two cars ahead of me.... This is the norm by the way, not an exception. Be prepared.... to go elsewhere if you have any other options at all."
982,"I have never had to literally call a McDonalds and complain about customer service in a drive through, or at all for that matter! But, tonight both of the workers were so unbelievably rude. They threw our food in the bag, slammed it on the counter and practically through it at us. I get it is a fast food placem bit, this was unacceptable."
983,"i think everyone else summed up how bad it is. just avoid. some mcdonald's are good, but this one is just badddd"
984,Lived in the neighborhood 4 years and have never stopped in.  And never will again.  The right hand dosen't know what the left is doing and the manager on duty has zero customer skills.
985,"I had the worst possible experience coming to this location. Rude workers, and the manager was rude, ignorant and mean towards customers. Sign claims they cater to ALL DAY breakfast, yet at 10 AM they had no mcgriddles left. After sitting at the drive through for 20 minutes I asked for a refund FIVE times with the manager ignoring me and after the fifth time asking the manager finally responded rudely telling me I should have said I wanted a refund earlier, which I did. I finally left and went to Burger King because they definitely have better service then whatever this trashy place did.

Second chance, 8 months later ..... it's worse. Avoid 

""I would like a biscuit"".  ""We don't got no plain biscuits. Only have sausage biscuits""."
986,"I used to eat here until I had a delivery driver tail me the entire way down Elm Street clearly not paying attention to the 30 mph sign, As I braked to turn into my street he almost ran into the back of me and proceeded to speed around me in the turning lane giving me a nasty look. Also living down the street from them or you see delivery drivers with cigarettes and Vape pens in their mouth all the time."
987,They are the rudest fast food restaurant I've ever been to and I've been to some really bad ones. I order a large Big Mac meal with extra onions and extra pickles and they literally gave me around 2 inches of onions and a medium fry instead of the large that I ordered. When I confronted her about the fries she snatched them out of my hands and threw them across the way into the trash. The fries she replaced mine with were old and stale and I ended up throwing away my whole meal. Also when I was giving my order the lady on the intercom kept sighing and saying ugh! Maybe I should have seen the reviews before I came...
988,"I was only order 1 item, 20 chicken nuggets.
It take foreeeeeveer like prob 10mins.
Not mention the line was crazy for midnight.
I think they need more employee at night.
They only gave me 10 instead of 20, I'm not happy at all!!!"
989,The lady was nice that the window. The food didn't seem good I ordered a Baconator. It seemed burnt and dry. It could of just been a bad night.
990,"They left a flyer in our hotel, and then when we called they said they wouldn't deliver, very annoying."
991,"No thanks. I should have known better than to eat mall pizza. Even looking at the pizzas sitting in the display case should have been a warning. The pizza slice was large, but no flavour and cheap ingredients. They could have given it to me for free and it would have been too much.

I did buy it and eat it and hoped that it tasted better than it looked. Save your money. Don't waste your calories."
992,Poor customer  service . I will not come back here . They really need to improve the service time i ordered two sandwiches  and had to pull over for them to be cooked.
993,"I have never seen anything like this.  5 cars reversed out of the drive through because it was hopeless.  I went inside to find a bunch of angry customers, none with food, and a stoned employee giggling who thought the whole thing was hilarious.   There was garbage all over the floor, both in the kitchen and the dining room. I took pictures to email to the health inspector. If my business ran like this one, I would be out of business.  Absolutely disgusting."
994,In the last six months or so I've tried to order from my dominoes app at this outlet maybe three times and twice I was called right back after placing my order to be told that there was a 2 hour wait on deliveries. This last time was at 1:45pm on Saturday? Judging by the other reviews there are some major issues with this franchise. I'm really surprised corporate Dominoes puts up with this sort of thing?! I'll call the store on 5th Street to see if they can delivery to my address and if not I'll delete the app and try a competitor. It's a shame. I like(d) dominoes.
995,"The staff here is so rude. I've only been here because it is the closest McDonalds and I get cravings. I've never met more miserable McDonalds staff. They don't even greet you or tell you to have a nice day. Makes me skeptical of what goes on in the kitchen. Plus, it should not be called fast food. People have waited over twenty minutes for their order."
996,"This is the worst fast food restaurant on the planet. The employees are rude, the food is poorly made, and they do not care about serving what you want.

The first time I went here, they were rude over the loudspeaker and impatient with my questions. I ordered about 8 items, and several of the items they told me that I couldn't have it because ""it would take too long."" In other words, if it's not already made, they don't want to get it out of the freezer.

When I finally ordered all the items they did have, I pulled forward and gave them my credit card. They told me to go park and they'd bring me my credit card. I told them no, I'd wait for my card since it only takes a second to swipe. The woman proceeded to argue with me and told me that I would mess up their timer if I didn't pull forward. I reasserted that I would not leave my card. She ran my card, which took less time than than it took her to argue with me. Then she told me to go park because my food wasn't ready. It took another 7 minutes (I timed it) before my food came out. (By the way, there was nobody in the drive-through behind me.)

As I drove away, I noticed two items missing, and two items I did not order. I went back to the store to swap them out for what I actually ordered. They told me that they were out of those two items, so they substituted....without telling me.

For some reason, I decided to go back today and order a grilled stuft burrito and a water. It took the lady about a minute to understand that I just wanted a cup of ice water and not a bottle, but she proceeded to charge me the price of a soda. So I told her I didn't want any water. She was very rude and short with me. When I got my burrito, it was neither grilled nor stuffed. It looked scrawny, the rice was hard, and it was barely warm.

I generally avoid fast food, but for some reason decided to try this place. Don't bother."
997,"Yelp wont let me give half a star, but if I could that is exactly what this MacDonald's would get! Worse service ever!!! 

The night I went the lady was talking on the phone in the drive thru while taking my order. Get to the next window and that woman was just as rude. I agree McDonald's is not the ""perfect"" job,  however it is a place of business and should be treated as such. There are so many people without work, and if the people working at this establishment do not care how business is ran they need to find a new form of employment.  Some where far from society."
998,"If you want cold bread, cold cheese, no even warm hamburger meat, employees that don't have a care in the world and are illiterate....then Burger King on Terry Pkwy is the place you need to be 

Seriously, this place has been terrible for many years now and it's surprising that it's still here. When I lived on the westbank, I might have had 1 or 2 times that this place was actually quick, friendly and the food tasted as it should. Owner/Management need to either let this franchise go and move it to a different location. The workforce around that area is terrible"
999,"TONIGHT I ORDERED A MILKSHAKE. I was so excited to hear that the machine was not down.. lol. However upon returning to my home, I took a nice large sip, and I kid you not this THING tasted like a mixture of lead and plastic. I know there milkshakes are just a mix, so I'm not sure if it was spoiled or what the issue was, but it is safe to say I will not be back. This is not the first time I've had an issue here, but it will be the last."
